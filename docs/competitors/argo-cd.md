## What it is

Argo CD is a **declarative, GitOps continuous-delivery controller for Kubernetes**, and the most
widely deployed member of this category. Its premise is a single sentence from its own concept
documentation: sync status is "whether or not the live state matches the target state" — *is the
deployed application the same as Git says it should be?*
([core concepts](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core_concepts/)).

- **Product boundary.** It reconciles Kubernetes manifests from a source of truth into clusters,
  reports health and drift, and syncs. It does not build images, provision infrastructure, choose
  providers, or model an application above the Kubernetes object level.
- **Operating model.** Open source, CNCF Graduated, self-hosted in-cluster.
- **The differentiator is the diff.** Every other GitOps tool reconciles. Argo CD's distinctive
  contribution is making the *difference* between intended and actual state a continuously computed,
  browsable, per-resource object that a human can look at before acting.

## Core primitives and mental model

| Primitive | What it is |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **Application** | "A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest" — a CRD pairing a source (repo, path, revision) with a destination (cluster, namespace) |
| **Target state** | "The desired state of an application, as represented by files in a Git repository" |
| **Live state** | "The live state of that application. What pods etc are deployed" |
| **Sync** | "The process of making an application move to its target state" |
| **Sync status** | Whether live matches target — `Synced` or `OutOfSync` |
| **Health** | "The health of the application, is it running correctly? Can it serve requests?" — assessed per resource kind, with custom Lua assessments for CRDs |
| **Refresh** | "Compare the latest code in Git with the live state. Figure out what is different" |
| **AppProject** | The tenancy boundary: which repos, destination clusters/namespaces and resource kinds a group of Applications may use |
| **ApplicationSet** | A CRD that templates many Applications from *generators* — list, cluster, Git, matrix — substituting parameters into `{{parameter name}}` within a `template:` block |
| **Sync waves / hooks** | Ordering and lifecycle escapes within a sync (pre-sync, sync, post-sync, sync-fail) |

The mental model is **two states and the gap between them**. Argo CD never claims to own the
application; it owns the continuously-recomputed assertion that what is running is or is not what was
written down, and the machinery to close the gap on demand or automatically.

## Feature surface

- Application CRD with automated or manual sync, self-heal, and prune.
- Continuous drift detection with a per-resource diff, including the live manifest.
- Health assessment per resource kind, extensible via Lua.
- A web UI, CLI and gRPC/REST API over the same model — the UI is genuinely load-bearing here in a
  way it is not for its main rival.
- Multiple manifest sources: plain YAML, Kustomize, Helm, Jsonnet, and config-management plugins.
- ApplicationSet generators for fleet and monorepo fan-out.
- AppProjects, SSO, RBAC and per-project resource allowlists/denylists.
- Sync waves, hooks and resource-level sync options.
- Notifications, and rollout strategies via the sibling Argo Rollouts project.
- App-of-apps as the conventional composition pattern.

## Architecture

- **Control plane** — three long-lived components: the **application-controller** (reconciles and
  computes diffs), the **repo-server** (renders manifests from sources), and the **API server**
  (serves the UI, CLI and RBAC). State lives in Kubernetes resources and a Redis cache; there is no
  external database.
- **Reconciliation loop** — poll or webhook, render, diff against live, then sync automatically or
  wait for a human.
- **Multi-cluster** — a hub-and-spoke model by default: one Argo CD instance holds credentials for
  many destination clusters and pushes into them. This is the architectural fork with Flux, and it
  carries a real consequence — the hub is a high-value credential store and a blast radius.
- **Extension model** — config-management plugins for rendering, Lua for health, and CRDs for
  everything else.
- **State authority** — Git (or an OCI artifact, or a Helm repo) is nominally authoritative;
  in practice the cluster is authoritative and Git is the assertion Argo CD tests it against. The
  distinction matters when they disagree, which is the entire product.
- **Portability boundary** — Kubernetes-only, and Kubernetes-shaped: an Application's source is a
  path producing Kubernetes objects. Nothing in the model survives leaving Kubernetes.

## How it competes with HoBo

Argo CD and HoBo overlap on *reconciliation and delivery* and nowhere else. It is not a rival for the
application model; it is the tool that would run underneath one.

| Contested HoBo surface | The contest |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `reconciliation` | **The real overlap.** Both continuously compare intent to reality; Argo CD's version is more mature, better instrumented, and has a UI |
| `delivery` | Sync, waves, hooks and (with Rollouts) progressive delivery against HoBo's stage gates |
| `environments` | Argo CD models an environment as a destination cluster/namespace plus a path; HoBo models it as a first-class promotion target |
| `governance` | AppProject allowlists and RBAC against `@hobo/policy` packs |
| `app-graph` | The resource tree UI is a derived graph, and a very good one — but of Kubernetes objects, not of application intent |

The honest framing: **Argo CD is a render target and an integration, not a competitor**. HoBo's claim
is about the layer above — describing an application without naming Kubernetes and choosing where it
runs. Once that decision is made and the target is a cluster, Argo CD is a reasonable thing for HoBo
to emit into.

## Primitive mapping

| Argo CD | Nearest HoBo concept | Honest correspondence |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Application | Deployed unit within a Camp | Partial. HoBo's unit is provider-abstract; Argo CD's is a path that yields Kubernetes objects. |
| Target state / live state | Intended state vs. materialized view | **Close, and Argo CD's is better developed.** HoBo has the event log to derive both, but no equivalent per-resource diff surface. |
| Sync status (`OutOfSync`) | — | **No first-class HoBo equivalent.** This is the gap this capture exists to record. |
| Health assessment | Readiness signal | Partial; Argo CD's per-kind, extensible assessment is more specific than anything HoBo ships. |
| Sync wave / hook | Stage gate ordering | Partial. Waves order resources within one sync; HoBo's gates order promotions between environments. |
| AppProject | Camp / Yard scoping | Close in role. Argo CD's allowlist of permitted repos, destinations and kinds is a tighter admission surface than it first appears. |
| ApplicationSet generator | Fleet fan-out over match results | **The instructive mapping.** Both turn one description into many per-target realizations; Argo CD's generators are declarative and composable (matrix), HoBo's fan-out follows from `match.Decided`. |
| Config-management plugin | Provider adapter | Only structurally; a rendering escape hatch, not a capability port. |
| — | `match.Decided` / `PortabilityReport` | **No equivalent.** The destination is written in the Application, not chosen. |
| — | `evaluateResidency` | **No equivalent.** Residency is whatever cluster the destination names. |

## Where Argo CD is stronger

- **Drift is a computed, visible fact.** `OutOfSync` with a per-resource diff is the single most
  valuable idea in this category, and HoBo does not have an equivalent surface. An event log can
  *derive* drift; Argo CD *shows* it, unprompted, to someone who was not looking for it.
- **The UI is the product, and it is good.** The resource tree, health rollup and live-vs-desired
  diff are what operators actually use during an incident. This corpus repeatedly finds that a
  browsable topology surface is the thing users want (six occurrences now); Argo CD is the best
  existing evidence of what it should look like.
- **Ubiquity and ecosystem.** CNCF Graduated, enormous install base, and an assumption of presence in
  most Kubernetes shops — which is an argument for integrating rather than displacing.
- **ApplicationSet generators** are a genuinely well-factored answer to fleet fan-out, including a
  matrix combinator that composes two generators.
- **Operational maturity.** Sync waves, hooks, retry, prune protection, self-heal and drift
  notifications exist because the failure modes were found in production years ago.
- **Progressive delivery via Argo Rollouts** — analysis-driven canaries and blue/green with automated
  rollback, which HoBo does not have.

## Where HoBo is stronger or intentionally different

State labels follow the research contract.

- **No Kubernetes premise** (*implemented*). Argo CD's entire model is Kubernetes objects; HoBo
  describes capabilities and resolves them to managed services, wasm hosts (ADR-0031) or a local
  runtime, of which a cluster is one option.
- **Placement is a recorded decision** (*implemented*, `match.Decided`). Argo CD's destination is a
  field someone typed.
- **Portability is measured** (*implemented*, ADR-0144). Argo CD has no notion of an application
  being more or less portable — it is Kubernetes or it is nothing.
- **Residency is fail-closed** (*implemented*, ADR-0146). Destination clusters carry no jurisdiction
  semantics.
- **Event-sourced authority with replay** (*implemented*, ADR-0135). Argo CD's history is Git's
  history plus a bounded operation log; there is no replay of the control plane's own decisions.
- **Typed contracts at boundaries** (*implemented*, ADR-0136). Argo CD reconciles untyped YAML; a
  malformed manifest is a sync failure, not a contract violation caught before deploy.
- **Honest caveat.** On the surface where they actually overlap — showing an operator what differs
  between intent and reality — Argo CD is ahead of HoBo, and HoBo has no comparable UI at all.

## Adversarial critique

- **It reconciles YAML, not applications.** Argo CD has no idea what a service *is*; it knows a set
  of objects that should exist. Every abstraction above that lives in Helm values or Kustomize
  overlays, which is why those become the real application model and are famously unpleasant.
- **The hub is a credential concentrator.** Push-mode multi-cluster means one instance holds
  admin-equivalent credentials to every cluster it manages. Flux's pull model does not have this
  property, and this is the strongest architectural criticism of Argo CD.
- **App-of-apps is a convention, not a feature.** Composition at scale is done by an Application
  whose manifests are other Applications, which works and is nobody's design.
- **`OutOfSync` is noisy in practice.** Mutating admission webhooks, defaulted fields and controllers
  that write back to spec produce permanent false drift, managed by ignore rules that accumulate
  until they hide real drift. The best idea in the product is also its most common operational
  complaint.
- **Helm rendering is second-class.** Argo CD renders charts rather than letting Helm own the
  release, so `helm list` shows nothing and chart hooks behave differently. This surprises people.
- **Scaling is a known operational project.** Large installs need sharding of the application
  controller, repo-server tuning and Redis capacity planning; the defaults do not carry a large
  fleet.
- **Security history.** As a component holding cluster credentials and exposing a UI, it has had
  serious CVEs, including path-traversal and authentication issues. This is not a reason to avoid
  it — it is a reason not to treat it as an inert piece of plumbing.
- **Nothing about drift is *prevented*.** Argo CD detects and corrects; it does not stop the manual
  `kubectl edit` that caused it. Admission control is a different product.

## Better-together / integration posture

- **Render target** — the most defensible relationship. HoBo decides *where* and *what*; when the
  answer is a cluster, emitting an Application (or the manifests an existing Application tracks) puts
  HoBo above a tool the customer already runs rather than in competition with it. This is the same
  posture as the [wadm render target](kubevela.md) reached for KubeVela (ADR-0108).
- **Integrate** — Argo CD's health and sync status are the highest-quality signal available about
  what a cluster is actually doing. Reading it into HoBo's materialized views is more valuable than
  reimplementing it.
- **Borrow** — three specific things:
  1. **Make drift a first-class computed fact with a name.** HoBo should have an equivalent of
     `OutOfSync` derived from its event log, surfaced without being asked for.
  2. **The resource-tree diff UI.** This is the concrete shape of the browsable topology surface this
     corpus keeps identifying as missing.
  3. **ApplicationSet generators**, specifically the matrix combinator, as prior art for fan-out over
     match results.
- **Benchmark** on drift detection and operator-facing diff presentation.
- Not a displace target: HoBo does not want to be a Kubernetes reconciler.

## Threats and lessons

1. **Drift detection is the category's actual product, and HoBo lacks it.** Reconciliation is table
   stakes; *showing a human the difference* is what people pay attention to. HoBo's event log makes
   this derivable and nothing derives it. This is the strongest single finding in this cohort.
2. **Argo CD's presence is an integration argument, not a competitive one.** In the enterprises
   HoBo's residency and policy features target, Argo CD is already installed. A story that requires
   removing it is a worse story than one that sits above it.
3. **False drift erodes trust in true drift.** If HoBo builds a drift surface, the ignore-rule
   problem arrives with it. The design question is not "can we detect divergence" but "can we
   distinguish divergence that matters" — and typed contracts (ADR-0136) are a better basis for that
   answer than field-level ignore globs.
4. **Push-mode credential concentration is a real architectural cost.** HoBo's own multi-target
   design should prefer pull or outbound-only agent connectivity, which is now the fourth corpus
   occurrence of that lesson after Harness's Delegate, Porter and Control Plane.
5. **The layer above untyped YAML is unclaimed.** Argo CD's own users build application models in
   Helm values because the tool does not offer one. That vacuum is precisely where HoBo's Bindle
   kinds claim to sit, and it is the clearest commercial argument in this capture.
