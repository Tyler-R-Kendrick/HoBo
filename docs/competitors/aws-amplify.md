# AWS Amplify — competitor reference

> A faithful capture of **AWS Amplify** for HoBo competitive analysis. Amplify **Gen 2** is — alongside Encore — the **closest *authoring* analog** to HoBo: **infrastructure-from-code in TypeScript** (`defineBackend`/`defineData`/`defineAuth`/`defineStorage`/`defineFunction`) that, **layered on AWS CDK**, synthesizes and provisions a whole fullstack backend, plus a Git-driven fullstack-branch hosting product and a UI component library. The decisive contrast: Amplify is **AWS-only**, **CDK-bound**, with a **fixed resource→service mapping** (Data→AppSync+DynamoDB, Auth→Cognito, Storage→S3) — where HoBo is multi-cloud + pluggable-IaC + wasm + auditable Matching.

## What it is

AWS Amplify is **AWS's fullstack application platform**. Since **Amplify Gen 2** (GA **May 6, 2024**) the backend is a **"TypeScript-based, code-first developer experience (DX) for defining backends"** — you *"deploy cloud infrastructure by simply expressing your app's data model, business logic, authentication, and authorization rules completely in TypeScript."* You author files under a convention (`amplify/auth/resource.ts`, `amplify/data/resource.ts`, `amplify/storage/resource.ts`, `amplify/functions/*/resource.ts`) and compose them in **`amplify/backend.ts`** with **`defineBackend({ auth, data, storage })`**. Amplify is **"layered on top of AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)"** — Data and Auth wrap **L3 AWS CDK constructs** — so the TypeScript declarations synthesize to CloudFormation and provision the matching AWS managed services, and you can drop to raw CDK for anything Amplify doesn't cover.

The mental model is **infrastructure-from-code (IfC)**, the same authoring thesis HoBo adopts ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)) — declare what the app needs in the same TypeScript you build with, and the platform provisions it. This makes Amplify Gen 2 a **genuinely close authoring analog to HoBo** (and to Encore). The crucial difference is the *target and the mapping*: Amplify emits **only AWS**, via **only CDK/CloudFormation**, with a **fixed** resource→service mapping — `defineData` always becomes **AWS AppSync (GraphQL) + Amazon DynamoDB**, `defineAuth` always becomes **Amazon Cognito**, `defineStorage` always becomes **Amazon S3**, `defineFunction` always becomes **AWS Lambda (Node/TypeScript)**. There is no notion of "the same app, a different cloud, a different IaC engine, or a different backing service."

Two things Amplify ships that HoBo (design-phase) does not yet: a **fullstack Git-branch hosting product** (**Amplify Hosting**: connect a repo, each branch gets its own frontend build **and its own backend stack**, with PR previews and SSR) and a **UI component library** (**Amplify UI**: themeable, cloud-connected React/Vue/Angular/Flutter/Swift/Android components such as `Authenticator`, `FileUploader`, `StorageImage`). Both are mature and shipping at AWS scale.

| Dimension | AWS Amplify |
|---|---|
| Authoring | **Infrastructure-from-code in TypeScript** — `defineBackend`/`defineData`/`defineAuth`/`defineStorage`/`defineFunction` under `amplify/`, **layered on AWS CDK** (synth → CloudFormation) |
| Backend resources | **Data** (AppSync GraphQL + DynamoDB) · **Auth** (Cognito) · **Storage** (S3) · **Functions** (Lambda) · custom queries/mutations · scheduled functions · **any AWS service via the CDK escape hatch** |
| Data model | `a.schema({ Todo: a.model({…}).authorization(allow => […]) })`; every `a.model()` "automatically creates … a DynamoDB table … [and] query and mutation APIs" on AppSync; typed generated client (`client.models.Todo`, real-time `observeQuery`) |
| Auth | `defineAuth({ loginWith: { email, phone, externalProviders: Google/Facebook/Amazon/Apple/SAML/OIDC } })` → **Amazon Cognito**; MFA, groups, passwordless (email/SMS OTP, WebAuthn passkeys) |
| Authorization | per-model/field `.authorization(allow => [...])` — `allow.publicApiKey()`/`owner()`/`authenticated()`/`guest()`/`groups()`; Storage path rules `allow.authenticated.to(['read','write'])`, `allow.entity('identity')` |
| Runtime | AWS-managed services (AppSync · DynamoDB · Cognito · S3 · Lambda); custom logic in **TypeScript/Node Lambda** handlers |
| Local dev | **per-developer cloud sandbox** `npx ampx sandbox` — deploys a **real, isolated backend to your AWS account**, watches `amplify/`, hot-swaps on save ("up to 8× faster" iterative updates); **no local emulation of AWS** |
| CLI | **`ampx`** (`@aws-amplify/backend-cli`) — `sandbox` (+ `secret`/`seed`/`delete`), `pipeline-deploy`, `generate outputs`/`graphql-client-code`/`forms`/`schema-from-database`, `info` |
| Clouds | **AWS only** |
| Hosting / deploy | **Amplify Hosting** — Git CI/CD (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/CodeCommit), **fullstack per-branch environments** (frontend build **+ its own backend stack**), PR previews, **SSR** (Next.js/Nuxt/Astro/SvelteKit + custom adapter), global CDN, custom domains, atomic deploys, password-protected branches |
| Frontend | **Amplify UI** — themeable React/Vue/Angular/Flutter/Swift/Android components incl. connected `Authenticator`, `FileUploader`, `StorageImage` |
| AI | *(no first-class AI/agent surface in the framework)* |
| License / price | Framework OSS (**Apache-2.0**, `aws-amplify/amplify-backend`); **Hosting metered** (build min · CDN · SSR); **backend AWS usage billed separately** at standard AWS rates |

## Feature surface

### Infrastructure-from-code — the `defineBackend` loop

Resources are declared as typed objects in convention files and composed in `amplify/backend.ts`. `defineBackend` returns a handle whose sub-resources expose the underlying CDK constructs (the escape hatch, below).

```typescript
// amplify/backend.ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
import { data } from './data/resource';
import { storage } from './storage/resource';

const backend = defineBackend({ auth, data, storage });
```

Amplify **synthesizes** these declarations through AWS CDK into CloudFormation and provisions the matching AWS services; **"Gen 2 automatically generates your types without the explicit codegen step."**

### Amplify Data — AppSync GraphQL + DynamoDB, typed end-to-end

```typescript
// amplify/data/resource.ts
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({ content: a.string(), isDone: a.boolean() })
    .authorization((allow) => [allow.publicApiKey()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'apiKey',
    apiKeyAuthorizationMode: { expiresInDays: 30 },
  },
});
```

Per the docs, **"every `a.model()` automatically creates the following resources in the cloud: a DynamoDB database table to store records [and] query and mutation APIs"** on **AWS AppSync**, with **real-time subscriptions**. The frontend uses a generated, fully-typed client:

```typescript
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '../amplify/data/resource';

const client = generateClient<Schema>();
await client.models.Todo.create({ content: 'buy milk' });
client.models.Todo.observeQuery().subscribe({ next: ({ items }) => { /* live-updating */ } });
```

Authorization is expressed **per model/field** via the `allow` builder — `allow.publicApiKey()`, `allow.owner()`, `allow.authenticated()`, `allow.guest()`, `allow.groups([...])` — this is Amplify's direct analog to HoBo's `.allow()`. Amplify Data can also front an **existing SQL database** (RDS/Aurora MySQL/PostgreSQL) via `ampx generate schema-from-database`, but the **default, first-class model is DynamoDB (NoSQL)**.

### Amplify Auth — Cognito

```typescript
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    externalProviders: {
      google: { clientId: secret('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'), clientSecret: secret('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET') },
      callbackUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/'],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/'],
    },
  },
});
```

**"Amplify Auth is powered by Amazon Cognito"** — user registration, sign-in, account recovery, external providers (Google/Facebook/Amazon/Apple/SAML/OIDC), MFA, groups, and passwordless (email/SMS OTP, WebAuthn passkeys). `defineFunction` handlers can be attached as **Cognito triggers** (pre-sign-up, post-confirmation, etc.).

### Amplify Storage — S3

```typescript
// amplify/storage/resource.ts
import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'amplifyTeamDrive',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'profile-pictures/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read']),
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'picture-submissions/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write']),
      allow.guest.to(['read', 'write']),
    ],
  }),
});
```

**"Built on top of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)"** — path-scoped access rules keyed by role (`guest`/`authenticated`/`entity('identity')`) with verb lists.

### Amplify Functions — Lambda, and custom resolvers

```typescript
// amplify/functions/say-hello/resource.ts
import { defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
export const sayHello = defineFunction({ name: 'say-hello', entry: './handler.ts' });
```

```typescript
// amplify/functions/say-hello/handler.ts
import type { Handler } from 'aws-lambda';
export const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => 'Hello, World!';
```

Functions are **"powered by AWS Lambda"**, authored/consumed in TypeScript, and wire into Data as **custom query/mutation resolvers**:

```typescript
sayHello: a.query()
  .arguments({ name: a.string() })
  .returns(a.string())
  .handler(a.handler.function(sayHello)),
// → client.queries.sayHello({ name: 'Amplify' })
```

They also serve as **auth triggers**, REST handlers, and **scheduled jobs** (cron/rate schedules).

### CDK escape hatch — the "no ceiling within AWS" story

Because Amplify **is** CDK underneath, you can add any AWS resource and reach into Amplify-generated constructs:

```typescript
const backend = defineBackend({ auth, data, storage });
const customStack = backend.createStack('MyCustomResources');   // dedicated CFN stack
new sqs.Queue(customStack, 'CustomQueue');                      // any aws-cdk-lib / Construct Hub construct

// reach underlying L1/L2/L3 constructs Amplify generated:
backend.data.resources.tables['Todo'];      // the DynamoDB table
backend.auth.resources.userPool;            // the Cognito user pool

backend.addOutput({ custom: { topicArn: '...' } });   // expose values to the frontend config
```

This is the mechanism that makes Amplify **AWS-deep** — but it is also **AWS-bound**: the escape hatch is *more CDK*, never a different cloud or IaC engine.

### `ampx` CLI, sandbox & CI/CD

```bash
npx ampx sandbox                 # deploy a personal cloud sandbox; watch amplify/ + redeploy on save
npx ampx sandbox --once          # single deploy, no file watching
npx ampx sandbox --name feature  # a named/second sandbox (--identifier); also --stream-function-logs, --profile
npx ampx sandbox secret set …    # manage per-sandbox backend secrets
npx ampx sandbox seed            # seed the sandbox with data
npx ampx sandbox delete          # tear the sandbox down

npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch main --app-id …   # deploy a branch backend in CI/CD
npx ampx generate outputs                 # write amplify_outputs.json (client config)
npx ampx generate graphql-client-code     # GraphQL statements + types
npx ampx generate forms                   # React form components from the data model
npx ampx generate schema-from-database    # TS schema from an existing SQL DB
npx ampx info                             # environment diagnostics
```

The **sandbox** is the local loop: it provisions a **real, isolated backend into the developer's AWS account** (not a local emulator) and hot-swaps on save — high fidelity by construction, but it **requires cloud credentials and incurs AWS usage**, and there is **no offline/local emulation** of AppSync/DynamoDB/Cognito.

### Amplify Hosting — Git CI/CD, fullstack branches, SSR

Amplify Hosting is a **"Git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web applications with continuous deployment"** onto the AWS CDN. You connect a repo (**GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / AWS CodeCommit**); then:

- **Fullstack per-branch environments** — each connected branch builds the frontend **and provisions its own backend stack**; **"all you have to do to get this app shared with a URL is to commit this to git and push to the origin."** Production and staging are just branches.
- **Pull-request previews** — ephemeral preview environments per PR.
- **SSR** — Next.js and Nuxt first-class; Astro/SvelteKit via community adapters; "any SSR framework with a custom adapter." SPA (React/Angular/Vue/Ionic/Ember) and SSG (Gatsby/Hugo/Jekyll/Eleventy/VuePress) supported.
- **Custom domains, atomic deployments, password-protected branches, redirects/rewrites, end-to-end tests.**

### Amplify UI — connected component library

**"A collection of accessible, themeable, performant React (and more!) components that can connect directly to the cloud."** Connected components collapse cloud workflows to a tag: **`Authenticator`** (full sign-up/sign-in/MFA flow over Cognito), **`FileUploader`** (formerly `StorageManager`, S3 uploads), **`StorageImage`** (render S3 objects), plus primitives (Button/Badge/…) and themes. Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, plus Flutter/Swift/Android.

### Pricing

- **Build & deploy** (Amplify Hosting build compute): **Standard (8 GB / 4 vCPU)** "No cost up to 1,000 build minutes per month," then **$0.01/min**; **Large (16 GB / 8 vCPU) $0.025/min**; **XLarge (72 GB / 36 vCPU) $0.10/min**.
- **Hosting**: **CDN storage** "No cost up to 5 GB … per month," then **$0.023/GB-month**; **data transfer out** 15 GB free, then **$0.15/GB**.
- **SSR compute**: **500,000 requests/month free**, then **$0.30 per 1M**; **100 GB-hours/month free**, then **$0.20 per GB-hour**.
- New AWS customers (from **July 15, 2025**) get up to **$200 in Free Tier credits** applicable to Amplify.
- **Backend resources billed separately**: **"Cognito, AppSync, DynamoDB, Lambda, and S3 operate under separate AWS pricing models with their own free tiers and usage-based charges."** Amplify does not bundle or abstract that spend — it is standard AWS usage, and cost visibility is on you (Cost Explorer / third-party FinOps).

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what Amplify does well)

- **Deep, first-party AWS-native integration** — managed **AppSync (GraphQL)**, **DynamoDB**, **Cognito**, **S3**, **Lambda**, **CloudFront**, wired together with IAM, shipping at AWS scale. This is real, production-grade depth HoBo (design-phase) does not have.
- **Genuine IfC-in-TypeScript on CDK** — `defineBackend`/`defineData`/`defineAuth`/`defineStorage`/`defineFunction` is a clean, typed authoring model; per-model typed data + generated typed client + **real-time subscriptions** (`observeQuery`) is a strong end-to-end DX.
- **Shipping fullstack-branch DX** — commit + push = a shared URL **with its own backend**; PR previews; a per-developer **cloud sandbox** with fast hot-swap. Mature and live today.
- **Amplify UI component library** — connected `Authenticator`/`FileUploader`/`StorageImage` collapse auth/storage UIs to a tag; a large frontend accelerator with no HoBo equivalent yet.
- **CDK escape hatch** — `backend.createStack()` + `aws-cdk-lib` + reaching Amplify's own constructs means **no hard ceiling within AWS**.
- **SSR hosting** for Next.js/Nuxt/Astro/SvelteKit with global CDN, atomic deploys, custom domains.
- **OSS framework (Apache-2.0)**, pay-as-you-go, generous free tier, and the full weight of the AWS ecosystem/support/compliance behind it.

### Gaps (Amplify's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **AWS-only; CDK-bound; fixed resource→service mapping.** `defineData` **always** → AppSync+DynamoDB, `defineAuth` **always** → Cognito, `defineStorage` **always** → S3, `defineFunction` **always** → Node Lambda. No Azure/GCP/Cloudflare/Fly/edge/on-prem; you **cannot** repoint a resource to a different backend, and you **cannot** swap the IaC engine — the escape hatch is *more CDK*. HoBo is **multi-cloud + IaC-agnostic** (Pulumi/Crossplane/TF/OpenTofu) with typed provider-native escape hatches ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04) / [ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)), and adds **Resource Definitions + Matching** so the same app realizes differently per environment, auditably (`match.Decided`, [Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25) / [ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)) with a cost-routing **Dispatcher** ([ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)).
- **TS/Node-only backend logic.** Handlers are Lambda (JavaScript/TypeScript); the authoring language is TypeScript, full stop. HoBo's runtime contract is **language-neutral WIT** — any wasm-compiling language ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)), with TS explicitly *not* required for the reference impl ([ADR-0069](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069) / [ADR-0072](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0072)).
- **Single default data paradigm (DynamoDB) behind AppSync.** No first-class relational/SQL model (only a connector for a pre-existing RDS/Aurora), **no graph, no vector/search** as Amplify resources. HoBo formalizes a **paradigm taxonomy** ([ADR-0052](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0052)) with **opt-in packages** `@hobo/sql`/`vector`/`graph`/`document` ([ADR-0081](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0081)), first-class **vector + search** ([ADR-0034](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0034)), and SQL **migrations** ([ADR-0032](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0032)).
- **No event-sourced control plane / audit-replay**, no **durable actor/workflow/saga** runtime, no **contracts/`can-deploy`/policy** planes, and no **platform-governance layer** over the app itself (you inherit AWS IAM/CloudTrail). HoBo ships an **event-sourced runtime + actors/workflows/sagas + replay** ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11) / [ADR-0003](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0003)/[ADR-0004](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0004)/[ADR-0050](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0050)), **governance planes** (Contract/Eval/Policy/Trace, [ADR-0015](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0015)), **contracts/policy/flags** ([Plan 29](../design/contracts-policy-flags.md#plan-29)), and **org/RBAC/SSO/SCIM** ([ADR-0074](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0074)).
- **No multi-tenant-app primitives.** Amplify gives no app-tenant model, tenancy spectrum, per-tenant isolation/routing/quota/residency — a SaaS builder rolls their own atop Cognito. HoBo ships this as a capability ([Plan 50](../design/security-networking.md#plan-50) / [ADR-0079](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0079) / [ADR-0080](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0080)).
- **No AI/agent-native surface in the framework.** No agents-as-principals, no MCP control surface, no AI-generated providers/implementations, no trainable functions. HoBo makes **agents first-class principals** with brokered tokens + MCP ([Plan 6](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)), ships an **AI generation pipeline** for providers/impls + UI generation (`ui-render`, [ADR-0056](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0056)) conformance-gated ([Plan 23](../design/generated-stack.md#plan-23) / [ADR-0010](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0010)), and `"use training"` self-optimizing methods.
- **Lock-in gradient.** The framework is OSS, but the value is the **managed AWS services + Amplify Hosting**; leaving means rewriting off AppSync/DynamoDB/Cognito/S3 wiring, and there is no documented "adopt an existing estate in place." HoBo's **Yard is itself a Bindle** (self-host = hosted parity, [Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)) and **`hobo import`** adopts TF/Pulumi/Lakebed/FaaS estates incrementally ([ADR-0041](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0041)).
- **Backend spend is standard AWS usage, unabstracted** — cost visibility falls to Cost Explorer / third-party tools. This is Amplify's model **by design**; HoBo deliberately ships **no billing/monetization** ([ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)) and treats metering as **OSS FinOps showback** ([ADR-0039](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0039)).

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** Amplify is **IfC-in-TS → AWS (via CDK)**, with managed AppSync/DynamoDB/Cognito/S3, a **shipping** fullstack-branch DX, and a **UI component library**; HoBo is **IfC → any cloud via pluggable adapters + pluggable IaC**, any **wasm** language, **event-sourced + AI-native + governed**. Amplify is the sharpest proof that HoBo's *authoring model* is right **and** the clearest reminder that a deep-pocketed AWS-native incumbent already ships the DX. HoBo's edge is the surrounding system — **breadth (clouds/languages/IaC) + control-plane planes + data-paradigm breadth + AI-native depth** — not the `define*` ergonomics themselves.
- **vs Encore:** both are IfC-in-TS that provision *real* cloud. Encore is cloud-agnostic-ish (**AWS + GCP**) via its own compiler; Amplify is **AWS-only** but **built on CDK** (hence a first-class CDK escape hatch) and ships **managed GraphQL/identity + a UI library + Hosting**. Both **fix** the resource→service mapping.
- **vs Nitric:** Nitric is **multi-cloud** IfC via a gRPC membrane + swappable Pulumi/Terraform providers; Amplify is **AWS-only + CDK**. Nitric is portable-by-design; Amplify is AWS-deep.
- **vs SST/Ion:** SST is also "IfC on AWS via CDK/Pulumi (Ion)" — both are AWS-centric TypeScript; Amplify adds **first-party managed Data/Auth/Storage/UI + Hosting** where SST leans on you to compose constructs.
- **vs Convex / Supabase / InsForge:** managed BaaS; Amplify is **AWS-first-party and CDK-extensible** rather than a single opinionated managed runtime, and deploys into *your* AWS account.
- **vs raw CDK/CloudFormation:** Amplify **is** the high-level IfC layer over CDK — less ceremony, fixed opinions, and raw CDK available when you need it.

**Net:** AWS Amplify Gen 2 is the **AWS-native proof of HoBo's IfC-in-TypeScript authoring model** — and unlike HoBo it **ships today** with deep managed services (AppSync/DynamoDB/Cognito/S3), a mature fullstack-branch DX, and a **UI component library HoBo does not yet have**. But it is **AWS-only, CDK-bound, fixed-mapping, TS/Node-only, single-paradigm (DynamoDB), with no event-sourcing/governance/multi-tenant/AI-agent planes**. HoBo's differentiation is exactly that surrounding system: **multi-cloud + pluggable-IaC breadth, a language-neutral wasm runtime, Resource Definitions/Matching + the Dispatcher, a broad data-paradigm catalog, event-sourced governance, cross-cloud data, multi-tenant-app primitives, and AI-native depth** — while conceding Amplify's shipping AWS-native depth and mature developer experience.

### Amplify-as-validation, and where Amplify is genuinely ahead

Amplify Gen 2 **validates HoBo's core bet** — infrastructure-from-code in a typed language, with per-resource authorization (`allow.*`) that mirrors HoBo's `.allow()`, provisioning real cloud from declarations. It is the strongest evidence that the `define*` authoring shape is the right ergonomic. But honesty requires naming Amplify's **shipping lead**: (a) a **mature managed data/identity/storage stack** (AppSync + DynamoDB + Cognito + S3) that HoBo has only *designed* ports for; (b) a **fullstack Git-branch hosting product** with SSR that HoBo does not yet ship (HoBo has a `web` port + Harness delivery, marked ◐); and (c) a **UI component library** (`Authenticator`/`FileUploader`/`StorageImage`) with **no HoBo equivalent** (HoBo has a UI *generation* path, marked 🔜). On those three axes Amplify is ahead today.

### The one-line takeaway

**Amplify Gen 2 proves HoBo's IfC-in-TypeScript authoring model on AWS — and ships managed AppSync/DynamoDB/Cognito/S3, fullstack Git-branch hosting, and a UI library that HoBo (design-phase) does not yet have.** HoBo's differentiation is everything *around* that authoring core: **multi-cloud + pluggable-IaC breadth (vs Amplify's AWS-only, CDK-bound, fixed mapping), a language-neutral wasm runtime (vs TS/Node-only), Resource Definitions/Matching + the Dispatcher, a broad data-paradigm catalog (vs DynamoDB-default), event-sourced governance, cross-cloud data, multi-tenant-app primitives, and AI-native depth — with billing a deliberate non-goal ([ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)) where Amplify passes through standard AWS usage.**
