# Infrastructure-from-Code & Authoring

> Category index. Full research lives in each canonical capture — see [`../metadata-contract.md`](../metadata-contract.md) for why this page carries rows, not research.

## Category boundary

Developer authoring frameworks that infer or provision infrastructure from application code, typed resources, bindings, permissions, and deployment intent.

## Why HoBo competes here

HoBo's authoring surface is an IfC surface. This category is the most direct contest over how a developer declares what their application needs.

## Competitors (10)

| Competitor | Role in this category | Directness | Contested HoBo surface | Competitor advantage | HoBo distinction | Posture | Priority |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------- | -------- |
| [**.NET Aspire**](../aspire.md) *(primary)* | code-first app composition, local orchestration and deploy — closest authoring analog outside TypeScript | direct | `authoring`, `app-graph`, `wiring`, `environments` | Mature code-first composition with first-class local orchestration and a large .NET ecosystem. | HoBo is language-neutral, provider-abstract via Bindle kinds, and carries residency/portability scoring Aspire has no notion of. | borrow, benchmark | P1 |
| [**Alchemy**](../alchemy.md) *(primary)* | TypeScript-native engine-less IaC — competes on the authoring/provisioning core and is a candidate iac-alchemy adapter | direct | `authoring`, `typed-contracts`, `reconciliation`, `extensibility` | Engine-less TS provisioning with no state daemon; very fast provider authoring. | HoBo keeps a durable event-sourced state authority with replay and PortabilityReport scoring rather than ad-hoc reconcile. | borrow, benchmark | P1 |
| [**AWS Amplify**](../aws-amplify.md) *(primary)* | Gen-2 code-first TypeScript fullstack backend on AWS CDK — IfC-in-TS analog, AWS-only | overlapping | `authoring`, `typed-contracts`, `wiring` | Deeply integrated AWS backend generation with strong typed client codegen. | HoBo refuses single-cloud lock-in: the same manifest scores and deploys across providers. | benchmark | P3 |
| [**Encore**](../encore.md) *(primary)* | infrastructure-from-code for TS/Go that provisions into your cloud — closest product analog | direct | `authoring`, `app-graph`, `wiring`, `environments`, `delivery` | Full IfC product with hosted cloud, previews and observability already shipped. | HoBo separates intent from provider and scores portability instead of owning the cloud account. | displace, benchmark | P1 |
| [**Nitric**](../nitric.md) *(primary)* | cloud-agnostic infrastructure-from-code framework — authoring analog for typed resource declaration | overlapping | `authoring`, `typed-contracts`, `provider-matching`, `runtime-portability` | Clean IfC authoring with automatic least-privilege IAM inference. | HoBo separates intent from provider selection and scores impedance instead of assuming clean portability. | borrow, benchmark | P2 |
| [**SST**](../sst.md) *(primary)* | infrastructure-from-code full-stack framework on Pulumi/Terraform with typed Linking — close product analog | direct | `authoring`, `typed-contracts`, `wiring`, `environments` | Huge provider reach via Pulumi/Terraform plus excellent live local dev. | HoBo's portability is scored, and its state authority is an event log rather than a stack state file. | displace, borrow, benchmark | P1 |
| [**Wasp**](../wasp.md) *(primary)* | Rails-like full-stack framework driven by a declarative .wasp spec — App-Kit inspiration and packaging path | adjacent | `authoring`, `app-graph` | Very fast full-stack scaffolding from one declarative spec. | HoBo's spec drives provider-portable deployment, not a fixed React/Node/Prisma stack. | borrow, benchmark | P3 |
| [**Winglang**](../winglang.md) *(primary)* | cloud-oriented language compiling to Terraform — authoring analog and cautionary tale (Wing Cloud shut down 2025) | adjacent | `authoring`, `typed-contracts` | Novel preflight/inflight language design for cloud code. | HoBo stays in ordinary TypeScript; Winglang is also a cautionary tale about language-sized bets. | borrow, benchmark | P3 |
| [**KusionStack**](../kusionstack.md) | open-source intent-driven orchestrator whose AppConfiguration-matched-to-Workspace pipeline is the closest published architecture to HoBo's own | direct | `authoring`, `typed-contracts`, `app-graph`, `provider-matching`, `environments`, `extensibility` | Open source with essentially HoBo's pipeline shipped: KCL-typed AppConfiguration matched against a Workspace to generate an inspectable Spec, then applied. | Kusion composes intent with the one chosen workspace; HoBo scores candidate providers and records the choice, which is what makes cost- and residency-aware placement expressible at all. | displace, borrow, benchmark | P1 |
| [**Pulumi**](../pulumi.md) *(primary)* | the IaC engine HoBo stands on — an adopted adapter and borrow-source whose authoring model HoBo agrees with and whose altitude it deliberately sits above | adjacent | `authoring`, `typed-contracts`, `reconciliation`, `extensibility`, `wiring` | The Terraform bridge gives it the largest provider ecosystem in existence, Output<T> derives ordering from data flow, and the Automation API makes the engine embeddable. | Pulumi describes resources; HoBo describes capabilities and decides which resources satisfy them — and HoBo delegates downward to Pulumi rather than competing with it. | adopt, borrow, benchmark, integrate | P1 |
