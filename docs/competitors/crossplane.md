# Crossplane — competitor reference

> A faithful capture of **Crossplane** for HoBo competitive analysis. Crossplane is **not a head-on competitor** — it is a **borrow-source** and a **pluggable IaC adapter option** for HoBo. HoBo already borrows Crossplane's **reconciliation model + dev-vs-platform separation** ([vision.md](../design/vision.md), "What HoBo borrows"), and Crossplane is a first-party `IacProvider` adapter — the one used when a Camp's substrate is Kubernetes ([ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)). Crossplane is a **Kubernetes-based control plane for infrastructure** (v2 also applications): providers + managed resources, Compositions/XRDs, Composite Resources/Claims, composition functions, all driven by a continuous reconciler.

## What it is

Crossplane is an **open-source, CNCF-graduated control-plane framework** (Apache-2.0) for **platform engineering** — it extends **Kubernetes** with custom resources and controllers so platform teams provision and **continuously reconcile** external infrastructure (cloud services, databases, SaaS, on-prem) behind **declarative custom APIs**. Created by **Upbound**, open-sourced in 2018, it joined the CNCF as Sandbox (2020) → Incubating (2021) → **Graduated (Nov 2025)**, with 100+ releases, 3,000+ contributors from 450+ organizations. Its pitch: *"the cloud-native framework for platform engineering"* — apply "the declarative control model pioneered by Kubernetes" to **orchestrate anything**.

The mental model is a **control plane, not a one-shot deploy tool**. Where Terraform/Pulumi run an imperative apply, Crossplane installs **controllers** into a Kubernetes cluster that **run a reconcile loop forever**: they compare desired state (`spec.forProvider`) against the real external resource and drive the two together, **reverting out-of-band drift automatically** (change a value in the AWS console and Crossplane changes it back). Everything is a **Kubernetes API object** stored in **etcd** and served as a **CRD**, so kubectl, GitOps (Argo/Flux), RBAC, admission control, and the whole K8s ecosystem apply for free — at the cost that **you must run and operate Kubernetes** to use it.

Two layers stack on that base. **Providers** add the low-level catalog: each provider is an OCI package (`xpkg`) of CRDs + controllers for an external API (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, databases, SaaS), so a **Managed Resource (MR)** like an S3 `Bucket` becomes a Kubernetes object. **Compositions + Composite Resource Definitions (XRDs)** add the platform-engineering abstraction on top: platform teams **publish their own custom APIs** (an `XDatabase`, a `Platform`) that bundle many managed resources behind one developer-facing shape — the dev-vs-platform separation HoBo borrows. This is the **same platform-orchestrator thesis as Humanitec's Resource Definitions + Matching**, expressed as Kubernetes CRDs.

| Dimension | Crossplane |
|---|---|
| What it is | Framework to build **Kubernetes-based control planes** for infrastructure — and, in v2, applications |
| Authoring | **Declarative YAML** CRDs — `Provider`, `ProviderConfig`, Managed Resources, `CompositeResourceDefinition`, `Composition`, `Function`; **no code-first infrastructure-from-code** (functions are code, but the composition graph is YAML) |
| Core objects | **Provider** · **ProviderConfig** · **Managed Resource (MR)** · **Composite Resource Definition (XRD)** · **Composite Resource (XR)** · **Claim (XC)** (v1) · **Composition** · **Composition Function** · **Operation / CronOperation / WatchOperation** (v2) |
| Model | **Reconciliation** — controllers continuously drive external state to `spec.forProvider`; drift is auto-corrected (level-triggered, self-healing) |
| Abstraction | **XRD (custom API schema) + Composition (template of resources)** — platform teams publish APIs; app teams consume them |
| Substrate | **Runs on Kubernetes** (CRDs + controllers + etcd); "orchestrate anything" via installed providers |
| Targets | Any external API with a provider — hyperscalers (AWS/Azure/GCP), Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, databases, SaaS, on-prem; huge ecosystem via **Upbound Marketplace** + `crossplane-contrib` |
| Provisioning | **Delegated to providers** (each = CRDs + controllers); many providers **generated from Terraform schemas via [Upjet](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet)** |
| Programmability | **Composition Functions** — Go / Python / KCL / Go-templates, run as gRPC servers in pods; enable loops, conditionals, dynamic generation |
| AI | Upbound's *"AI-native / intelligent control plane"* direction (UXP 2.0); Crossplane itself is **API-first** — agents drive it via the Kubernetes API |
| License / commercial | **Apache-2.0** OSS (CNCF-graduated); **Upbound** sells **UXP** distribution, **Spaces** (control-plane-as-a-service), and a **Marketplace** (signed providers, SBOMs, LTS) |

## Feature surface

### The control-plane / reconciler model

Crossplane is a set of Kubernetes controllers. Installing it adds the core apiextensions controller; installing a provider adds its resource controllers. Each controller runs the **Kubernetes controller pattern** on a reconcile loop: read the desired state from the object's `spec`, observe the real external resource, and `Create`/`Update`/`Observe`/`Delete` to converge. State of record lives in **etcd**; the external resource's observed state is mirrored back into `status.atProvider`. Because reconciliation is **continuous and level-triggered**, Crossplane both provisions and **self-heals** — it is the property HoBo borrows for its `ResourceActor` / Delta→Set model ([vision.md](../design/vision.md), [Plan 04](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)).

### Providers & managed resources

A **Provider** is an OCI package (`xpkg`) that adds CRDs + controllers for an external API. Install it declaratively:

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-aws-s3
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/provider-aws-s3:v2.0.0
  # packagePullPolicy / revisionActivationPolicy / revisionHistoryLimit
```

A **ProviderConfig** supplies credentials; a Managed Resource references one via `providerConfigRef` (defaults to `default`):

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.m.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata: { name: default }
spec:
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef: { namespace: crossplane-system, name: aws-creds, key: creds }
```

A **Managed Resource (MR)** is the Kubernetes representation of one external resource. `spec.forProvider` is **Crossplane's source of truth** — it is enforced and drift is reverted:

```yaml
apiVersion: s3.aws.m.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  namespace: default          # v2: MRs are namespaced
  name: my-bucket
spec:
  forProvider:                # desired state; Crossplane overrides out-of-band changes
    region: us-east-2
  providerConfigRef: { name: default, kind: ProviderConfig }
  # managementPolicies: [Create, Update, Delete, Observe, LateInitialize]
  # crossplane.io/external-name annotation overrides the external resource name
  # writeConnectionSecretToRef publishes connection details to a Secret
```

Deletion is finalizer-guarded (the external resource is deleted first, then the Kubernetes object). Provider breadth is enormous and largely **machine-generated**: **Upjet** reads a Terraform provider's schema and emits the Go types, CRDs, and controllers for a Crossplane provider — mechanically transpiling Terraform coverage into Crossplane coverage (and shedding the Terraform CLI's BSL license).

### Compositions, XRDs, Composite Resources & Claims

The platform-engineering layer is three objects. An **XRD** defines the schema of a **custom API**; a **Composition** is the template of resources that API expands to; a **Composite Resource (XR)** is an instance developers create.

```yaml
# 1) XRD — define the custom API
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
metadata: { name: xdatabases.example.org }
spec:
  scope: Namespaced           # v2 default (v1 was Cluster + a namespaced Claim)
  group: example.org
  names: { kind: XDatabase, plural: xdatabases }
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    referenceable: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          spec:
            type: object
            properties: { region: { type: string } }
            required: [region]
```

```yaml
# 2) Composition — template of resources, pipeline mode
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Composition
metadata: { name: xdatabases.example.org }
spec:
  compositeTypeRef: { apiVersion: example.org/v1alpha1, kind: XDatabase }
  mode: Pipeline
  pipeline:
  - step: patch-and-transform
    functionRef: { name: function-patch-and-transform }
    input:
      apiVersion: pt.fn.crossplane.io/v1beta1
      kind: Resources
      resources:
      - name: bucket
        base:
          apiVersion: s3.aws.m.upbound.io/v1beta1
          kind: Bucket
          spec: { forProvider: { region: us-east-2 } }
        patches:
        - type: FromCompositeFieldPath
          fromFieldPath: spec.region
          toFieldPath: spec.forProvider.region
```

```yaml
# 3) XR — a developer consumes the custom API
apiVersion: example.org/v1alpha1
kind: XDatabase
metadata: { namespace: team-a, name: prod }
spec:
  region: us-east-2
```

**Claims (XC / XRC).** In **v1**, XRs were cluster-scoped and developers instead created a namespaced **Claim** that acted as a proxy: creating/updating/deleting the Claim created/updated/deleted a bound XR, which in turn owned all the composed resources. In **v2**, XRs are **namespaced by default**, so "there's no longer a need for claims" — claims are removed for the new namespaced/cluster-scoped XRs (the old behavior survives as `scope: LegacyCluster` for compatibility).

### Composition Functions

Native patch-and-transform composition was deprecated in v1.17 and replaced by **composition functions**. A `Function` is installed as a package and runs as a **gRPC server in a pod**; a Composition's `pipeline` invokes functions in order, each receiving the accumulated desired state and returning the next:

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: Function
metadata: { name: function-patch-and-transform }
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/function-patch-and-transform:v0.8.0
```

Functions are written in **Go, Python, or KCL** (plus Go-templating), so a Composition gains real programmability — **loops, conditionals, and dynamic resource generation** — beyond static YAML patches.

### Crossplane v2 (2025)

v2 is a substantial evolution ([announcement](https://blog.crossplane.io/announcing-crossplane-2-0/)):

- **Namespaced XRs by default** — the XRD `scope` field defaults to `Namespaced`; better multi-tenant isolation and RBAC.
- **Namespaced managed resources** — MRs are namespaced too (AWS fully, other providers being updated).
- **Claims removed** — unnecessary once XRs are namespaced.
- **Compose *any* resource** — a Composition can now bundle an MR *and* a native Kubernetes `Deployment` *and* a third-party CRD (e.g. a CloudNativePG `Cluster`) — Crossplane moves from "infrastructure control plane" toward **application control planes**.
- **Operations** — `Operation` (run once), `CronOperation` (scheduled), `WatchOperation` (event-triggered) run function pipelines to completion like a Kubernetes Job, for day-2 workflows.
- Housekeeping: XR machinery under `spec.crossplane`; native patch/transform removed; `ControllerConfig` deprecated; fully-qualified registry URLs required.

Even here the substrate is unchanged: composing a `Deployment` **orchestrates a Kubernetes object**; Crossplane reconciles it, it is not itself a durable application runtime.

### Upbound (commercial)

**Upbound** — Crossplane's creator — sells the enterprise layer: **UXP (Upbound Crossplane / "Universal Crossplane")**, an opinionated, enterprise-hardened distribution (free Community + commercial licenses), now marketed as an *"AI-native control plane"* (UXP 2.0); **Spaces**, a **control-planes-as-a-service** hosting environment that runs UXP for you (or self-managed on your own cluster); and the **Upbound Marketplace**, offering verified providers with long-term support, **package signing, SBOMs, and vulnerability remediation**. The OSS project runs standalone on any Kubernetes cluster with no Upbound dependency.

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what Crossplane does well)

- **Mature, CNCF-graduated (Nov 2025), production-proven at real scale** — 100+ releases, 3,000+ contributors, 450+ organizations. This is a battle-tested control plane, not a design.
- **Rock-solid reconciliation** — the Kubernetes controller pattern applied to infrastructure: continuous drift correction, self-healing, level-triggered convergence. The robustness HoBo's design aspires to and explicitly borrows.
- **Enormous provider ecosystem** — hyperscalers, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, databases, SaaS, on-prem, largely **auto-generated from Terraform schemas via Upjet**, distributed through a signed Marketplace with SBOMs and LTS.
- **Genuine platform-engineering primitive** — XRDs + Compositions let platform teams **publish custom self-service APIs** and app teams consume them: a clean dev-vs-platform separation (the Humanitec Resource-Definition-and-Matching thesis, as Kubernetes CRDs).
- **API-first and ecosystem-native** — everything is a Kubernetes object, so kubectl, GitOps (Argo/Flux), RBAC, admission control, and observability tooling all apply unchanged; agents drive it via the Kubernetes API.
- **Real programmability** — composition functions (Go/Python/KCL, gRPC) add loops, conditionals, and generation over static YAML.
- **A managed path** — Upbound Spaces/UXP for teams who don't want to operate it themselves.

### Gaps (Crossplane's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **Kubernetes-bound.** It **requires a running Kubernetes cluster**; state lives in **etcd**; every resource is a **CRD**; scaling means managing CRD/etcd/controller-memory pressure. HoBo treats **Kubernetes/Crossplane as an optional substrate adapter, never a requirement** — *"Kubernetes/Crossplane is an optional execution substrate adapter, never a requirement"* ([control-plane.md](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)); the Yard runs on a language-native core and the default wasm host is self-hosted wasmCloud ([ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)).
- **YAML, not code-first infrastructure-from-code.** Authoring is declarative YAML CRDs (Providers / MRs / XRDs / Compositions); functions are code but the composition graph is YAML. There is **no "declare a resource inline where your app uses it" + `.allow()`**. HoBo is **IfC + `.allow()` code-first** — one declaration yields IAM + a wasm capability link + an agent token scope ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)).
- **An infrastructure control plane, not an application runtime.** Crossplane provisions and reconciles external resources; even v2's "compose a `Deployment`" is **orchestrating a Kubernetes object**, not executing your application. There is **no durable, event-sourced application runtime** — no actors, durable workflows, sagas, or replayable event store. HoBo adds exactly that **above** infra reconcile ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11) / [ADR-0003](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0003) / [ADR-0004](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0004) / [ADR-0050](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0050)).
- **No wasm / polyglot component runtime.** Providers and functions are Go/Python/KCL containers; there is no WIT/WASI Component Model or capability-security link graph. HoBo is **wasm-default, any language → one component** ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20) / [ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)).
- **No agents-as-principals; providers hand-authored (or Terraform-transpiled).** Upbound markets an *"AI-native / intelligent control plane,"* but that is assistant/controller intelligence — **agents are not first-class identities** with brokered SPIFFE-style tokens, and providers are hand-written or **Upjet-transpiled from Terraform**, not **AI-generated and conformance-certified**. HoBo makes **agents principals** ([Plan 06](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)) and **generates providers/implementations** through a certified pipeline ([Plan 23](../design/generated-stack.md#plan-23) / [ADR-0010](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0010)).
- **Composition selection is not auditable "why this infra."** A Composition binds to an XR by type/label selector; there is no first-class recorded decision explaining *which* realization was chosen for *which* context. HoBo's **Matching** scores Resource Definitions by context and records a **`match.Decided`** event — an auditable "why this infra" (explicitly "Humanitec parity", [Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25) / [ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)).
- **Higher operational complexity.** Adopting Crossplane means operating **Kubernetes + Crossplane + a fleet of provider pods** (each provider is controllers + CRDs, often memory-hungry) + function pods + etcd + upgrades. That is the "must run K8s" tax; a small team pays a large operational floor. HoBo's **self-host = hosted** (the Yard is itself a Bindle, [Plan 04](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)) without mandating a control cluster.

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** **Not head-on.** Crossplane is a **K8s-native infrastructure control plane** (YAML/CRDs, reconciliation, huge provider ecosystem); HoBo is a **cloud-agnostic control plane + durable wasm runtime** that (a) **borrows** Crossplane's reconciliation + dev/platform separation ([vision.md](../design/vision.md)), and (b) can **drive Crossplane as one pluggable IaC adapter** ([ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)) — *"Crossplane = the adapter used when a Camp's substrate is Kubernetes"* ([control-plane.md](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)). Adjacent + borrow-source + adapter, not a replacement target.
- **vs Terraform / Pulumi / OpenTofu:** Crossplane is a **continuously-reconciling control plane** where the others are (drift-aware) apply engines. HoBo keeps **all four as `IacProvider` adapters, none primary** ([ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)); Crossplane provider config flows through `.with(...)` (e.g. composition selectors).
- **vs Humanitec:** the closest conceptual sibling — both realize *"developer requests an abstract resource → platform maps it to concrete infra."* Crossplane's XRD/Composition ≈ Humanitec's Resource Definitions + Matching, as Kubernetes CRDs. HoBo aligns with the **Humanitec Matching model** (records `match.Decided`) but can realize via Crossplane underneath — see [`humanitec.md`](humanitec.md#hobo-mapping).
- **vs Radius:** HoBo borrows from *"Crossplane/Radius"* jointly ([vision.md](../design/vision.md)); Radius is more application-graph-centric (recipes) over similar reconciliation — both inform HoBo's `bindle()` vs `camp()`/`yard()` split.
- **vs Encore / Nitric / Aspire:** those are **app-side IfC** (declare resources in app code); Crossplane is the **platform-side realization/reconcile engine** that could sit underneath them. HoBo unifies both layers — IfC authoring on top, Crossplane/TF/Pulumi/OpenTofu as realization adapters below.
- **vs wasmCloud (HoBo's default host):** wasmCloud *can* run on Kubernetes but doesn't require it; Crossplane requires it. Different layer, different substrate assumption.

**Net:** Crossplane is the **mature, CNCF-graduated realization engine** HoBo treats as a **pluggable IaC adapter** and a **borrow-source** (reconciliation + dev/platform separation) — **not a head-on competitor**. Its limits — Kubernetes-bound, YAML-not-IfC, infrastructure-not-application-runtime, no wasm, no agents-as-principals or provider generation, high operational complexity — are precisely the seams HoBo's design targets, while HoBo can still **stand on Crossplane** where a Camp's substrate is Kubernetes. Crossplane's advantages today (provider-ecosystem breadth, reconciliation robustness at scale, K8s-native operational maturity) are real and shipping; HoBo is **design-phase**, so those remain Crossplane's to keep.

### Crossplane-as-borrow-source and IaC adapter (not a target to replace)

> **Design-suite posture:** the XRD/Composition/Claim ↔ Resource Definition mapping and the definition-versioning rules it inspired are now normative in [ADR-0144](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0144) — vocabulary alignment only; the core IR never depends on Crossplane's continued dominance.

Two relationships, both deliberate. **(1) Borrow.** HoBo takes Crossplane's **reconciliation model and dev-vs-platform separation** wholesale ([vision.md](../design/vision.md)) — the `bindle()` (provider-agnostic) vs `camp()`/`yard()` (provider-specific) scope split, provider recipes, and equivalence classes are Crossplane's idea, re-expressed as HoBo SDK objects. **(2) Adapter.** Crossplane is a **first-party `IacProvider`** alongside Pulumi/Terraform/OpenTofu, none primary ([ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)); when a Camp's substrate is Kubernetes, HoBo realizes resources **through** Crossplane (compositions + managed resources, reconciliation delegated to K8s controllers), with Crossplane-specific settings passed via `.with(...)`. HoBo's net-new is the layer **around** that engine: code-first IfC, a wasm-default runtime, an event-sourced/durable app runtime, auditable Matching, agents-as-principals, and provider generation.

### The one-line takeaway

**Crossplane is HoBo's reconciliation borrow-source and a pluggable IaC realization adapter — not a head-on competitor.** HoBo maps Crossplane's Compositions/XRDs onto **Resource Definitions + Matching** (adding an auditable `match.Decided`), can even **stand on Crossplane** when a Camp is Kubernetes, and borrows its reconciliation + dev/platform separation — while reaching past Crossplane's **Kubernetes-bound, YAML, infrastructure-only** control plane to a **cloud-agnostic, code-first, wasm-default, durable-event-sourced, agent-native** platform. Where Crossplane is a mature graduated project (provider ecosystem, reconciliation at scale, K8s-native ops) and HoBo is design-phase, that maturity is Crossplane's — credited honestly as ◐/🔜.
