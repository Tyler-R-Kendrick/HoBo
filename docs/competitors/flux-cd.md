## What it is

Flux CD is a **set of small, composable Kubernetes controllers implementing GitOps by pull**. Its own
concept documentation defines the target: a system where "the whole system is described declaratively
and version controlled, and having an automated process that ensures that the deployed environment
matches the state specified in one or more Git repositories"
([concepts](https://fluxcd.io/flux/concepts/)).

- **Product boundary.** It fetches sources, renders them, applies them, and reconciles. It has no
  application model, no build system, and — deliberately — no UI.
- **Operating model.** Open source, CNCF Graduated, installed *into each cluster it manages*.
- **The differentiator is the direction of trust.** The controllers run inside the cluster they
  reconcile and pull from a source. Nothing outside the cluster ever needs credentials to it. This is
  the single most important architectural difference in this category.
- **Gitless GitOps.** Flux also pioneered a model where "Flux controllers are fully decoupled from
  Git, relying solely on container registries as the source of truth for the desired state of
  Kubernetes clusters" — desired state as a signed OCI artifact rather than a branch.

## Core primitives and mental model

| Primitive | What it is |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **Source** | A repository origin producing "an artifact that is consumed by other Flux components to perform actions" — `GitRepository`, `OCIRepository`, `HelmRepository`, `Bucket` |
| **Kustomization** | A reconciliation of a rendered path from a source into the cluster, with pruning, health checks, dependencies and a target namespace |
| **HelmRelease** | A Helm release managed declaratively, with Helm itself owning the release |
| **Reconciliation** | "Ensuring that a given state (e.g. application running in the cluster, infrastructure) matches a desired state declaratively defined somewhere" |
| **Bootstrap** | Installing Flux by committing its own manifests to a repository, so Flux manages Flux |
| **Image automation** | `ImageRepository`, `ImagePolicy` and `ImageUpdateAutomation` — scan a registry, pick a version by policy, and *write the change back to Git* |
| **Alert / Provider / Receiver** | The notification-controller's outbound events and inbound webhooks |

The mental model is **artifacts flowing one way, inward**. A source controller turns a repo or
registry into an artifact; a reconciler consumes that artifact and applies it. Every piece is a
separate controller with its own CRDs, and a platform is assembled from them.

## Feature surface

- Git, OCI, Helm-repository and S3-compatible bucket sources, with signature and checksum
  verification.
- Kustomize and Helm rendering; server-side apply with drift correction and pruning.
- Dependency ordering between Kustomizations and health-check gating.
- Image scanning with policy-based version selection and automated commits back to Git.
- Notification and webhook receivers for event-driven reconciliation.
- **Multi-tenancy by impersonation** — controllers "impersonate (assume the identity of) a service
  account mentioned in the apply specification", so tenant operations are constrained by Kubernetes
  RBAC rather than by the controllers' own permissions.
- Isolation flags that harden that model: `--no-cross-namespace-refs=true` denies "cross-namespace
  access to Flux custom resources, thus ensuring that a tenant can't use another tenant's sources or
  subscribe to their events"; `--no-remote-bases=true` ensures "all resources refer to local files,
  meaning only the Flux Sources can affect the cluster-state"; `--default-service-account` forces
  unspecified workloads onto a minimal-permission account.
- `flux` CLI for bootstrap, inspection and manual reconciliation.
- Terraform/Pulumi providers and the Flux Operator ecosystem for installation.

## Architecture

- **Control plane** — there isn't one, in the Argo sense. Five specialised controllers
  (source, kustomize, helm, notification, image-automation) run in the cluster they manage, each
  reconciling its own CRDs. State is Kubernetes resources; no database, no Redis, no API server of
  its own.
- **Reconciliation loop** — poll or webhook → fetch and verify artifact → render → server-side apply
  → correct drift → report status on the CR.
- **Multi-cluster** — by installing Flux in each cluster and pointing it at a path. There is no hub.
  A management cluster *can* apply to remote clusters via kubeconfig references, but the default and
  recommended shape is per-cluster.
- **Security model** — the strongest in this category: no inbound connectivity, no external
  credential store, RBAC-constrained impersonation per tenant, and verifiable (signed) artifacts.
  This is the concrete answer to the credential-concentration criticism levelled at push-mode tools.
- **State authority** — the source artifact, verified; the cluster is reconciled toward it.
- **Portability boundary** — Kubernetes-only, and more tightly so than Argo CD: every primitive is a
  CRD reconciled by an in-cluster controller. There is no meaningful Flux outside a cluster.

## How it competes with HoBo

Flux is **infrastructure HoBo would sit above**, not a rival application model.

| Contested HoBo surface | The contest |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `reconciliation` | The direct overlap: continuous convergence with drift correction |
| `delivery` | Dependency ordering, health gating and image-policy promotion against HoBo's stage gates |
| `identity-secrets` | **Where Flux is genuinely instructive** — impersonation plus isolation flags is a well-designed least-privilege story |
| `governance` | Tenant isolation enforced by RBAC and controller flags rather than by policy documents |
| `environments` | An environment is a cluster plus a path; promotion is a commit |

Flux contests nothing above the Kubernetes object level, which is exactly where HoBo's claim lives.

## Primitive mapping

| Flux CD | Nearest HoBo concept | Honest correspondence |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Source (`GitRepository` / `OCIRepository`) | Bindle source resolution | Partial. Flux's artifact is rendered Kubernetes YAML; HoBo's is a typed capability description. |
| Kustomization | Deployed unit realization within a Camp | Partial; Flux's is Kubernetes-shaped and HoBo's is provider-abstract. |
| HelmRelease | Resource Pack instantiation | Partial. |
| Reconciliation loop | Materialized-view convergence | Close in spirit; Flux converges cluster state, HoBo converges recorded intent across heterogeneous providers. |
| **Service-account impersonation** | Least-privilege provider credentials | **The instructive mapping.** Both want the actor to hold only the rights the workload needs; Flux's is enforced by the Kubernetes API itself, which is stronger than a policy check. |
| `--no-cross-namespace-refs` | Camp/Yard scoping of provider escapes (ADR-0144) | Close in role: a hard boundary on what one tenant may reference. |
| Image automation (commit back to Git) | — | **No HoBo equivalent.** Writing a decision back into the customer's repository is a mechanism HoBo does not have. |
| Alert / Receiver | Event projections and webhooks | Partial. |
| Bootstrap (Flux manages Flux) | — | No equivalent; HoBo's control plane is not self-hosted through its own model. |
| — | `match.Decided` / `PortabilityReport` | **No equivalent.** The target is where the controller is installed. |
| — | `evaluateResidency` | **No equivalent.** |

## Where Flux CD is stronger

- **No credential concentration.** The controller runs where it applies. Nothing outside the cluster
  holds admin-equivalent credentials to it — the cleanest security posture in this category, and a
  direct answer to Argo CD's principal weakness.
- **Least privilege that is actually enforced.** Impersonation means a tenant's reconciliation runs
  as a service account the platform team chose, and the Kubernetes API rejects overreach. Policy
  engines *evaluate*; this *cannot*.
- **Composability.** Five independent controllers with clean CRD boundaries can be adopted
  piecemeal — several products in this corpus embed the source-controller alone.
- **Gitless GitOps.** Treating a signed OCI artifact as the desired state removes Git from the
  critical path and makes provenance verifiable — a better primitive than "trust this branch".
- **Helm is a first-class citizen.** The helm-controller drives Helm properly, so releases behave the
  way Helm users expect, unlike rendering-based approaches.
- **Image automation closes the loop.** Scanning a registry, selecting by policy and committing the
  change is a complete promotion mechanism that most tools in this corpus leave to CI.
- **Small operational surface.** No database, no cache tier, no UI to secure.

## Where HoBo is stronger or intentionally different

State labels follow the research contract.

- **No Kubernetes premise** (*implemented*). Flux is a set of Kubernetes controllers; it has no
  meaning off-cluster, whereas HoBo resolves the same intent to managed services, wasm hosts
  (ADR-0031) or a local runtime.
- **An application model above the objects** (*implemented*). Flux reconciles rendered YAML; the
  description of *what the application is* lives in Kustomize overlays, which is not a model.
- **Placement is a recorded decision** (*implemented*, `match.Decided`) rather than a consequence of
  where someone installed a controller.
- **Portability is measured** (*implemented*, ADR-0144).
- **Residency is fail-closed** (*implemented*, ADR-0146).
- **Event-sourced authority with replay** (*implemented*, ADR-0135). Flux's history is Git history
  plus CR status; the reconciler's own decisions are not replayable.
- **Typed contracts with effects** (*implemented*, ADR-0136) against untyped manifests.
- **Honest caveat.** On least-privilege execution and credential handling, Flux is ahead of HoBo, and
  its approach is enforced by the platform rather than checked by a policy pack.

## Adversarial critique

- **No UI is a real cost, not just an aesthetic choice.** During an incident, `kubectl describe` on a
  Kustomization is worse than a resource tree. Third-party UIs exist and are not the product. This is
  the honest reason Argo CD has broader adoption despite the weaker security model.
- **The debugging path is indirect.** A failure surfaces as a condition on a CR, which references an
  artifact, produced by another controller, from a source that may itself be failing. The
  composability that makes it elegant makes the failure chain long.
- **Multi-cluster is an exercise for the reader.** "Install it everywhere" is a legitimate answer and
  also means fleet-wide visibility, rollout coordination and cross-cluster ordering are the
  platform team's problem. [Rancher Fleet](rancher-fleet.md) exists largely because of this gap.
- **Kustomize overlays become the application model by default**, with the same criticism that
  applies to Argo CD's Helm values: an accidental abstraction layer nobody designed.
- **Image automation writing to Git is controversial.** It is a clean loop and it means a machine has
  commit access to the repository that defines production; some organizations will not accept that,
  and the ones that do should reason about it more carefully than they usually do.
- **The multi-tenancy story is opt-in.** The isolation flags above are *flags*. A default install is
  not tenant-isolated, so the strongest thing about Flux is off until someone turns it on — which is
  precisely the criticism [OpenShift](openshift.md) answers with enforced restricted defaults.
- **Version-2 migration was disruptive.** The rewrite from Flux v1 to the GitOps Toolkit was a
  genuine break, and it cost the project adoption momentum it has not fully recovered.
- **Bootstrap couples the platform to one repository's layout**, which is fine until the
  organization's repository strategy changes.

## Better-together / integration posture

- **Render target** — where HoBo's placement decision resolves to a cluster, emitting manifests that
  a Flux Kustomization reconciles is a defensible split: HoBo decides, Flux converges.
- **Integrate** — Flux CR conditions are a good source signal for HoBo's materialized views, in the
  same way Argo CD's health rollup is.
- **Borrow** — three things, and the first is the important one:
  1. **Pull, don't push.** HoBo's agents and provider adapters should prefer outbound-only
     connectivity so the control plane never holds standing credentials to the estate. Fifth corpus
     occurrence, after Harness, Porter, Control Plane and Argo CD's counter-example.
  2. **Impersonation as the execution identity.** HoBo should execute provider actions under an
     identity scoped to the workload, not under a platform credential that policy merely audits.
  3. **Signed artifacts as desired state.** Gitless GitOps is a better provenance story than a branch
     name, and it maps directly onto HoBo's Bindle distribution question.
- **Benchmark** on security posture — this is the bar HoBo's identity-secrets surface should be
  measured against.
- Not a displace target.

## Threats and lessons

1. **The control plane should not hold credentials to what it manages.** Flux is the corpus's
   clearest demonstration that this is achievable rather than aspirational, and it reframes HoBo's
   agent connectivity from a deployment detail into an architectural commitment.
2. **Enforcement beats evaluation.** Impersonation makes overreach impossible; a policy pack makes it
   *detectable*. Where HoBo can push a constraint down into the provider's own authorization system,
   it should, and `@hobo/policy` should be the fallback rather than the mechanism.
3. **Defaults decide whether a security model exists.** Flux's isolation is excellent and off by
   default; OpenShift's is mediocre by comparison and on. The second one protects more clusters.
   HoBo's policy packs should ship restricted.
4. **No UI is a market position, not just a gap.** Flux and Argo CD have comparable technical merit
   and very different adoption, and the difference is substantially the resource tree. This is
   further evidence for the browsable topology surface HoBo keeps deferring.
5. **Composable controllers get embedded.** Flux's source-controller shows up inside other products
   because it has a clean boundary. HoBo's ports should be shaped so that someone can adopt one
   without adopting the platform — that is how this category actually spreads.
