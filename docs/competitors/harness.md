## What it is

Harness is a **commercial, modular software-delivery platform**. The Harness Platform "provides the
shared foundation for all Harness modules and allows you to manage user access, authentication,
secrets, delegates, governance, and audit trails from a single control plane"
([Platform docs](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/)).

- **Product boundary.** Not one product but a module suite over a shared platform: Continuous
  Integration, Continuous Delivery & GitOps, Internal Developer Portal, Infrastructure as Code
  Management, Cloud Cost Management, Chaos Engineering, Security Testing Orchestration, Feature
  Flags, Database DevOps, plus AI/agent features. Each module is separately licensed.
- **Operating model.** SaaS control plane by default, with a **Self-Managed Enterprise Edition** for
  customers who must run the control plane themselves. Execution always happens on customer
  infrastructure via the Delegate.
- **Commercial status.** Proprietary and commercial, module-priced. Not open source.

## Core primitives and mental model

| Primitive | What it actually is |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| **Harness Manager** | The control plane: accounts, orgs, projects, RBAC, secrets, governance, audit |
| **Delegate** | "A service that connect[s] your artifacts, infrastructure, collaboration, verification, and other providers with Harness Manager", installed "behind your firewall and in the same VPC as the micro-services you are deploying" |
| **Connector** | A typed link to an external provider (cloud account, registry, repo), exercised by a Delegate |
| **Pipeline / Stage / Step** | The unit of execution, authored as YAML; Git Experience stores that YAML in the customer's repo |
| **Environment / Infrastructure / Service** | CD's deployment nouns: what is deployed, where, and into which target |
| **Module Registry (IaCM)** | "A centralized repository … to manage and publish versions of pre-built infrastructure modules", with versioning and search |
| **IDP catalog + plugins** | Backstage-shaped portal, including Frontend Plugins and proxy-enabled plugins that can route through a Delegate |

The mental model is **pipeline-centric**: everything is a governed pipeline execution, dispatched by
a SaaS control plane and executed by a customer-side worker. Governance, secrets and audit are
platform-wide rather than per-module.

## Feature surface

- **Authoring** — YAML pipelines (with a visual editor); Git Experience keeps pipeline YAML in the
  customer's Git repository.
- **Resource model** — Service / Environment / Infrastructure for CD; Terraform-shaped modules for
  IaCM through the Module Registry.
- **Environments and lifecycle** — first-class Environments with per-environment infrastructure
  definitions and promotion through pipeline stages.
- **Delivery** — full CD including GitOps (Argo-derived), progressive rollout strategies, approvals,
  and Continuous Verification (deployment-time analysis of observability signals).
- **Policy/governance** — OPA-based policy-as-code, RBAC, audit trails, all at the platform layer.
- **Identity/secrets** — platform secret managers plus connector-scoped credentials; the Delegate
  keeps credentials inside the customer's network.
- **Observability** — Continuous Verification, pipeline/deployment telemetry, plus module-specific
  dashboards.
- **Cost** — Cloud Cost Management: cost visibility, recommendations, and auto-stopping of idle
  resources.
- **Agents** — AI features across modules (pipeline generation, failure triage) marketed as AIDA;
  treat capability claims as claims to verify.
- **Extensibility** — connectors, custom pipeline steps, IDP plugins, IaCM module registry.
- **Self-host/BYOC** — Self-Managed Enterprise Edition; execution is always customer-side.

## Architecture

- **Control plane** — Harness Manager (SaaS or self-managed). Owns identity, policy, pipeline
  definitions, and orchestration decisions.
- **Data plane** — the customer's own infrastructure, reached only through Delegates.
- **Connectivity** — outbound only. "Harness Delegate connects to Harness Manager over an outbound
  HTTPS/WSS connection", using "a Secure WebSockets channel (WebSockets over TLS)" for heartbeats and
  task-event notification; notably "the channel is not used to send task data itself". No inbound
  ports are opened. This is the architecturally interesting part of Harness: a hosted control plane
  that never needs ingress into the customer network.
- **Execution model** — the Manager schedules tasks; Delegates poll/receive and execute them with
  local credentials. Delegates install as Kubernetes manifests, Docker containers, or Helm charts.
- **State authority** — the Manager's database for platform state; pipeline definitions can be
  Git-authoritative via Git Experience. Not an event-sourced log with replay.
- **Portability boundary** — Harness orchestrates whatever the Delegate can reach. It does not
  abstract the target: a Kubernetes deployment stage is a Kubernetes deployment stage.

## How it competes with HoBo

Harness overlaps HoBo **per module** rather than as a whole:

| Contested HoBo surface | Which Harness module, and how hard it presses |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `delivery` | CD/GitOps — the strongest overlap; mature promotion, approvals, verification, rollback |
| `governance` | Platform OPA policy, RBAC, audit — a shipped, org-wide governance layer |
| `environments` | CD Environments + Infrastructure definitions |
| `finops` | Cloud Cost Management — cost *visibility and recommendation*, adjacent to HoBo's cost-aware placement |
| `extensibility` | Connectors, custom steps, IaCM Module Registry |
| `observability` | Continuous Verification at deploy time |

What Harness does **not** contest: HoBo's provider-abstract application description. Harness has no
Bindle analog — no artifact that describes an application against abstract ports and is then matched
to a provider. It automates delivery *to* infrastructure you have already chosen.

Posture is therefore **benchmark and integrate**, not displace: a Harness customer could plausibly
run HoBo *inside* a Harness pipeline stage.

## Primitive mapping

| Harness | Nearest HoBo concept | Honest correspondence |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Harness Manager | HoBo control plane | Close in role; different state authority (database + Git vs event log). |
| Delegate | Relay / node-attach agent | **Genuinely close.** Both are customer-side workers reached without ingress. Harness's outbound-WSS-with-out-of-band-task-data split is a design worth studying. |
| Connector | Provider credential + provider adapter | Partial: a Connector is a credentialed link; a HoBo provider adapter also carries capability and impedance metadata. |
| Pipeline / Stage / Step | Stage gates + promotion events | **Different shape.** Harness's unit is an executable pipeline; HoBo's is a policy-gated state transition recorded as an event. |
| Environment / Infrastructure | Camp / Yard | Partial; HoBo's carry residency and provider-escape scope, Harness's do not. |
| IaCM Module Registry | Resource Packs / Bindle kinds | Partial: a registry of Terraform modules is concrete IaC; Bindle kinds are abstract capability contracts. |
| OPA policies | `@hobo/policy` packs | Close in intent. Harness's are shipped and enterprise-proven; HoBo's decide as events. |
| Cloud Cost Management | Budget-aware provider matching | **Different point in time.** CCM explains and trims spend after the fact; HoBo's cost input decides placement before it. |
| Continuous Verification | — | **No HoBo equivalent** today (*not-present*). Deploy-time signal analysis is a real gap. |
| IDP | — | HoBo is not a portal; Backstage-shaped portals are integration targets. |

## Where Harness is stronger

- **Delivery maturity.** Approvals, canary/blue-green, rollback, and verification are shipped,
  audited, and used in regulated enterprises. HoBo's promotion model is real but far younger.
- **The Delegate model.** Outbound-only connectivity into any customer network, with task data kept
  off the control channel, is a mature answer to a hard problem.
- **Platform-wide governance.** One RBAC, secrets, policy and audit layer across nine modules.
- **Continuous Verification.** Automated deploy-time regression detection from observability data.
- **Cost tooling.** CCM's recommendations and auto-stopping are shipped and measurable.
- **Ecosystem and support.** Enterprise sales, support, and integration breadth HoBo does not have.

## Where HoBo is stronger or intentionally different

- **Provider-abstract application intent** (*implemented*). Harness has no artifact that survives a
  change of target. HoBo's Bindle plus scored matching is a different, and for HoBo's thesis a more
  fundamental, layer.
- **Portability is measured** (*implemented*). `PortabilityReport` and thin-adapter impedance limits
  (ADR-0144) versus "the Delegate can reach it".
- **Event-sourced control plane** (*implemented*). Durable SQLite EventStore with stream-head CAS and
  fencing (ADR-0135); every decision replayable. Harness's audit trail records what happened; HoBo's
  log *is* what happened.
- **Cost decides placement, not just reporting** (*implemented* for matching inputs; cost-source
  breadth is narrower than CCM's).
- **Fail-closed residency** (*implemented*). `evaluateResidency` (ADR-0146) has no Harness analog.
- **No per-module licensing wall** — the whole surface is one open codebase.
- **Honest caveat.** Harness is a shipping enterprise platform with an eleven-figure customer base;
  HoBo's packages are not published to npm and its default Pulumi path is an in-memory stand-in (see
  the [live provider matrix](../design/live-provider-matrix.md)). The comparison is architectural.

## Adversarial critique

- **Module pricing is the product's real shape.** The "single platform" story is nine separately
  licensed modules; the total cost of the coherent experience is high, and partial adoption gives a
  partial platform.
- **Delegate operations are a standing burden.** Delegates must be sized, upgraded, and kept healthy
  in every network segment. Delegate version skew is a recurring source of failures.
- **The control plane is the vendor's.** Even with Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, the default
  posture puts orchestration decisions in Harness's cloud; the Self-Managed edition is a substantial
  operational undertaking of its own.
- **Pipeline YAML is a lock-in surface.** Harness pipeline YAML is not portable to any other runner
  despite living in the customer's Git repo. Git Experience makes the artifact *visible*, not
  *portable*.
- **No portable application model.** Harness cannot answer "run this application somewhere else"; it
  can only answer "run this pipeline against a different infrastructure definition".
- **AI claims outpace evidence.** AIDA-branded features are marketed across modules; the operational
  evidence is thinner than for CD, which is the mature core.
- **Acquisition-driven breadth.** Several modules arrived by acquisition or as separate products, and
  the seams show in UX and concept overlap (Environments in CD versus IaCM workspaces versus IDP
  entities).

## Better-together / integration posture

- **Integrate** — the realistic posture. A Harness pipeline stage invoking HoBo is coherent: Harness
  governs and executes, HoBo decides placement and owns the application model.
- **Benchmark** — CD maturity, Continuous Verification, and the governance layer are the bar.
- **Borrow** — the Delegate connectivity model (outbound-only control channel, task data out of band)
  is directly relevant to HoBo's Relay/node-attach path, and Continuous Verification is the shape of
  the deploy-time verification HoBo lacks.
- Not a displace target, and not a provider or render target.

## Threats and lessons

1. **Delivery is a solved, well-defended category.** HoBo should not try to out-feature Harness CD.
   Its promotion model needs to be *good enough and integrated*, not best-in-class.
2. **Deploy-time verification is a genuine HoBo gap** (*not-present*). Automated analysis of
   post-deploy signals with automatic rollback is worth a separate implementation issue.
3. **Outbound-only connectivity is table stakes for enterprise.** Any HoBo node-attach story must
   assume no inbound ingress, and should copy the "control channel carries events, not task data"
   split.
4. **Cost is being competed for at the wrong end.** CCM reports; HoBo decides. That framing is
   HoBo's clearest FinOps differentiator and should be stated that way in positioning.
5. **Beware suite envy.** Nine modules is a business strategy, not an architecture. HoBo's answer is
   one model that is portable, not nine that are not.

Product gaps identified here (deploy-time verification; richer cost sources) are recorded as lessons
and belong in their own implementation issues, per the research contract.
