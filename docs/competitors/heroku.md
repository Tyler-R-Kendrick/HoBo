# Heroku — competitor reference

> A faithful capture of **Heroku** for HoBo competitive analysis. Heroku is the **original developer-first PaaS**: `git push heroku main` builds your repo with a **buildpack** into an immutable **slug** and runs it on **dynos**, with **add-ons**, **config vars**, and **pipelines** wired in — the DX vocabulary most later platforms (Encore, Render, Railway, Fly, Nitric) inherit. Heroku **authored the Twelve-Factor App** methodology and has been **owned by Salesforce since 2010**. It remains a shipping product with a **200+ add-on marketplace**, first-party **Heroku Data** (Postgres/Key-Value/Kafka), a new **AI PaaS** surface (**Managed Inference and Agents**, MCP server hosting, **AppLink** → Salesforce/Agentforce), and a next-generation **Kubernetes-based "Fir"** platform. Two caveats frame the comparison: Heroku is **closed-source** and runs only on **Heroku-operated AWS** (you cannot bring your own cloud or account), and in **Feb 2026 Salesforce moved it into "sustaining engineering"** — freezing new feature development and halting new enterprise sales to redirect investment to enterprise AI.

## What it is

Heroku is a **fully managed platform-as-a-service** (PaaS): you push code (or a container), Heroku builds and runs it, and you scale by adjusting a **process formation** of **dynos** — lightweight, isolated Linux containers. The developer never touches VMs, load balancers, or orchestrators. The mental model is deliberately narrow and opinionated: declare your process types in a **`Procfile`**, keep configuration in **config vars** (environment variables), attach backing services as **add-ons**, and ship through **pipelines**. This "just push and it runs" experience — launched in 2007 and acquired by Salesforce in 2010 — is the reference point HoBo's "IfC → running app" loop is measured against, and the origin of the **Twelve-Factor App** conventions HoBo's config/secrets-as-references model inherits.

Heroku is now two platform **generations** in parallel. **Cedar** is the mature, 15-year-old runtime (classic buildpacks → slugs, IPv4, HTTP-router stack, the full add-on/pipeline/CI ecosystem). **Fir** — GA in April 2025 but **only via enterprise-only Fir Private Spaces** — is a rebuild on **Kubernetes over AWS** (EKS, **Graviton/ARM64** dynos, Global Accelerator) that uses **Cloud Native Buildpacks exclusively** to produce **OCI images**, is **IPv6-default**, and is **OpenTelemetry-native**. Fir is the future direction, but as of mid-2026 it is still catching up: autoscaling, Heroku CI, the Common Runtime, Docker builds, x86, and monorepo support are all documented as "To Be Added."

The strategic context is unavoidable and material to a competitive read: in **February 2026 Salesforce placed Heroku in a "sustaining engineering model"** — no new feature development, **no new enterprise contracts** for new customers, and staff reductions across Heroku and adjacent units — explicitly to redirect investment toward enterprise AI (Agentforce). Existing customers keep their apps and renewals with no price/service change, but the long-term roadmap is frozen. Heroku is thus simultaneously **the most polished, battle-tested PaaS in this comparison set** and **the one with the most uncertain future**.

## Feature surface

### The core loop — Procfile, buildpacks, slugs, dynos

You declare **process types** in a **`Procfile`** at the repo root — an alphanumeric name mapped to a command. The **`web`** process type is special: it is the **only** type that can receive external HTTP traffic from Heroku's routers. Other common types are `worker`, `clock`/scheduler, and the reserved **`release`** phase command that runs once on every deploy (migrations, cache warming):

```procfile
web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
worker: bundle exec sidekiq
release: bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

Deploy is `git push heroku main`. Heroku's **slug compiler** receives the push, **auto-detects a buildpack** (Ruby/Node/Python/Java/PHP/Go/Clojure/Scala + custom/community), runs `detect → compile → release`, and produces an immutable **slug** (source + fetched dependencies + language runtime + build output). A slug becomes a **release**; releases are immutable and versioned, so `heroku rollback` reverts to a prior release instantly. You scale by setting the **dyno formation**:

```bash
heroku ps:scale web=3 worker=2      # the dyno formation
heroku ps                           # process status
heroku ps:restart                   # cycle dynos
heroku run bash                     # one-off dyno (REPL / rake task)
heroku logs --tail                  # streamed logs
```

On **Fir**, the classic buildpack/slug path is replaced by **Cloud Native Buildpacks** that emit standard **OCI container images** — "the Heroku magic, as a portable container." Docker is also first-class on **Cedar** via the **Container Registry** (`heroku container:push web`, `heroku container:release web`, or a `heroku.yml` manifest), though Fir does not yet support Docker builds.

### Dynos — tiers, sizes, pricing

Dynos are billed **per second, prorated** at monthly-equivalent rates. The tiers (Cedar):

| Dyno | Price/mo | RAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Eco** | **$5** | 0.5 GB | 1,000-hour **shared monthly pool** across all Eco dynos; **sleeps** after 30 min idle |
| **Basic** | **$7** | 0.5 GB | Always-on, single size; no autoscaling/preboot |
| **Standard-1X** | **$25** | 0.5 GB | Multi-tenant; preboot, metrics |
| **Standard-2X** | **$50** | 1 GB | 2× Standard-1X |
| **Performance-M** | **$250** | 2.5 GB | **Single-tenant**, **autoscaling** |
| **Performance-L** | **$500** | 14 GB | Single-tenant, autoscaling |
| **Performance-L-RAM / -XL / -2XL** | **$500 / $750 / $1,500** | 30 / 62 / 126 GB | Larger single-tenant sizes |

**Private/Shield dynos** (network-isolated **Private Spaces**, ~$125–$1,800/mo) add single-tenant runtime + compliance (Shield adds HIPAA/PCI posture). **Fir** dynos are re-tiered (Classic/General-Purpose/Memory/Compute lines, roughly $25–$2,400/mo) and add **GPU dynos** (roadmap). The **free tier was removed in November 2022**.

### Config vars & the Twelve-Factor lineage

Configuration lives outside the codebase as **config vars**, surfaced to the app as **environment variables** — the model Heroku codified as **Factor III (Config)** of the Twelve-Factor App:

```bash
heroku config:set DATABASE_POOL=20 SECRET_KEY_BASE=…
heroku config:get REDIS_URL
heroku config:unset LEGACY_FLAG
```

Add-ons inject their own config vars automatically (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`), so wiring a backing service is "provision → env var appears."

### Add-ons & the Elements Marketplace

The **Elements Marketplace** lists **200+ add-ons** — managed backing services from third-party **Ecosystem Partners** who fully operate and support them. You provision by CLI; the add-on injects config vars and is **metered on your Heroku invoice** (a single-bill, revenue-share marketplace):

```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:standard-0 -a myapp
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:premium-0
heroku addons:create papertrail:choklad          # third-party logging
heroku addons:upgrade heroku-postgresql:premium-2
heroku addons                                     # list attachments
```

First-party **Heroku Data** add-ons anchor the catalog: **Heroku Postgres**, **Heroku Key-Value Store** (Redis-compatible), and **Apache Kafka on Heroku**.

### Heroku Data — Postgres, Key-Value, Kafka

**Heroku Postgres** is the flagship managed database with mature operational features — **forks**, read **followers**, **continuous protection / rollback**, and **Dataclips** (shareable SQL query snapshots). Tiers span **Essential** ($5–$20/mo, shared, ≤32 GB), **Standard** ($50–$12,000/mo, dedicated, ≤8 TB), **Premium** ($200–$24,000/mo, HA + 7-day rollback), and **Advanced** ($150–$40,000/mo, decoupled compute/storage). **Key-Value Store** (Redis) runs $3–$19,600/mo; **Apache Kafka** $100–$13,000/mo. Management is via `heroku pg:*` / `heroku data:pg:*`:

```bash
heroku pg:info
heroku pg:psql
heroku pg:backups:capture
heroku data:pg:create --tier advanced
```

### Pipelines, Review Apps, Heroku CI — "Heroku Flow"

**Heroku Flow** bundles four features into a continuous-delivery workflow:

- **Pipelines** — a group of apps that **share one codebase** across stages (**review → development → staging → production**). Because the compiled **slug is promoted** (not rebuilt), **`heroku pipelines:promote`** from staging to production is **near-instantaneous**.
- **Review Apps** — for a GitHub-connected app, **every open pull request** automatically spins up a **temporary, isolated app** at a unique URL; merging the PR destroys it and (with a pipeline) auto-promotes to staging. Review apps can provision their own ephemeral add-ons (e.g. an `essential-0` Postgres per PR).
- **Heroku CI** — a test runner integrated with pipelines that runs the app's test suite on every push/PR in a disposable environment.
- **GitHub sync** — auto-deploy a branch on push.

```bash
heroku pipelines:create myapp -s production
heroku pipelines:promote -a myapp-staging       # staging → production, instant
heroku reviewapps:enable -p mypipeline
```

### AI PaaS — Managed Inference and Agents, MCP, AppLink

Heroku's newest surface (**Managed Inference and Agents**, GA **May 15, 2025**) reframes it as an **"AI PaaS."** Models run on **Amazon Bedrock** inside Heroku's AWS boundary and are exposed through an **OpenAI-compatible API** across three categories — **chat/language** (e.g. `claude-4-5-sonnet`), **embedding** (e.g. `cohere-embed-multilingual`), **diffusion/image** (e.g. `stable-image-ultra`). You attach models as add-on resources and call them by alias or from the CLI:

```bash
heroku plugins:install @heroku/plugin-ai
heroku addons:create heroku-inference:standard -a myapp            # chat → INFERENCE_KEY/URL
heroku addons:create heroku-inference:standard -a myapp cohere-embed-multilingual --as EMBEDDING
heroku ai:models:list
heroku ai:models:call INFERENCE -a myapp --prompt 'What is 1+2?'

curl $INFERENCE_URL/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INFERENCE_KEY" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-4-5-sonnet", ...}'      # /v1/embeddings · /v1/images/generations
```

The **Agents** half adds **MCP** support: Heroku hosts **MCP servers** and lets a hosted LLM **run tools** — with automatic dyno provisioning/deprovisioning for tool execution, retries/error-correction, action traces in the output, and prompt caching. **AppLink** (GA) exposes a Heroku app (in **any language**, described by an **`api-docs.yaml` OpenAPI** file) as native **Salesforce actions** usable from **Flow, Apex, Data Cloud, and Agentforce** — the deep Salesforce-platform tie-in that distinguishes Heroku from every neutral PaaS.

### CLI surface (representative)

```bash
heroku apps:create · apps:destroy · apps:open
heroku ps · ps:scale · ps:restart · ps:exec        # dynos & formation
heroku config:set|get|unset                        # config vars
heroku addons:create|upgrade|destroy               # add-ons
heroku pipelines:create|promote · reviewapps:enable
heroku releases · rollback [VERSION]               # immutable releases
heroku run · logs --tail · domains:add
heroku buildpacks:add · container:push|release · apps:stacks:set
heroku pg:* · data:pg:* · redis:* · kafka:*
heroku ai:models:list|info|call                    # @heroku/plugin-ai
```

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what Heroku does well)

- **The lowest zero-to-deploy friction in the category, proven over 15+ years.** `git push heroku main` and a `Procfile` is still the gold standard for "code to running app in minutes." Heroku *invented* much of this vocabulary (dynos, buildpacks, slugs, config vars, add-ons) — the DX later platforms imitate.
- **Enormous, mature ecosystem.** A **200+ add-on marketplace** of fully-managed third-party services with single-invoice billing, first-party **Heroku Data** (Postgres/Redis/Kafka) with genuine operational depth (forks, followers, rollback, Dataclips), and a decade-plus of hardened runtime, routing, and support.
- **Operational track record.** Multi-tenant Common Runtime + network-isolated **Private/Shield Spaces**, existing **ISO/SOC** compliance, real incident history and tooling — the kind of production maturity a design-phase platform simply cannot claim.
- **Clean CI/CD story out of the box.** **Heroku Flow** (Pipelines + Review Apps + CI + GitHub sync) with **instant slug promotion** and one-command rollback is coherent and requires zero assembly.
- **Credible AI-PaaS pivot.** **Managed Inference and Agents** (Bedrock-backed, OpenAI-compatible), **MCP server hosting**, and **AppLink → Agentforce** are shipping, not slideware.
- **Cloud-native re-platforming underway.** **Fir** moves to Kubernetes/OCI/CNB with IPv6 + native OpenTelemetry + GPU dynos on the roadmap — a modern foundation.

### Gaps (Heroku's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **Closed-source, single-cloud, no BYO account.** Heroku runs **only on Heroku-operated AWS**; you cannot bring your own cloud, your own account, Azure/GCP, edge, or on-prem, and there is **no self-host / open-source core**. HoBo is **cloud-agnostic with pluggable IaC** (Pulumi/Crossplane/Terraform/OpenTofu) and **self-host = hosted parity** ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)/[ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)).
- **Frozen roadmap / uncertain future.** Salesforce's **Feb 2026 "sustaining engineering"** move (feature freeze, no new enterprise sales, staff cuts) means the platform's forward investment is redirected to AI — a strategic risk no amount of past polish offsets. HoBo's value is **OSS and self-hostable**, so its continuity does not depend on a single vendor's strategy.
- **Two-generation split with a shallow "new" tier.** **Fir** is GA in name but **Private-Spaces-only**, ARM-only, and missing autoscaling, Heroku CI, Common Runtime, Docker builds, x86, and monorepos ("To Be Added"). The mature path (Cedar) is the *legacy* one. HoBo targets **one coherent runtime** (wasm-default + OCI fallback) across environments ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)/[ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)).
- **No infrastructure-from-code / typed resource wiring.** Backing services are provisioned out-of-band (`addons:create`) and wired by convention (config-var env). There is **no in-code resource declaration, no `.allow()` least-privilege, no manifest/IR** the platform derives from source. This is exactly HoBo's authoring model ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)).
- **No platform-rules / same-app-different-infra layer.** A dyno size and an add-on plan are chosen manually per app; there is no auditable "cheap preview vs HA prod realization of the same declaration." HoBo adds **Resource Definitions + Matching** with a recorded `match.Decided` ([Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25)/[ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)) and a credit/budget-aware **Dispatcher** ([ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)).
- **No event-sourced runtime / durable-workflow / audit-replay model.** Releases are immutable and rollback is instant, but there is **no actor/workflow/saga substrate, no time-travel/replay, no audit event store** — you assemble that from add-ons (Kafka + your code). HoBo makes it the runtime ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11)/[ADR-0003](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0003)/[ADR-0004](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0004)).
- **Narrow language/build coupling.** Buildpacks are language-runtime-specific; there is no polyglot **component** model or capability-secured sandboxing. HoBo's contract is **language-neutral WIT / wasm** ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)).
- **AI story is model-hosting + Salesforce glue, not agents-as-principals.** Managed Inference is an *inference endpoint*; AppLink is *Salesforce-specific* integration. There is **no first-class agent identity, capability manifest, or brokered token model** for agents acting on the platform. HoBo treats **agents as first-class principals** with SVID/OIDC tokens + MCP control ([Plan 6](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)).
- **No brownfield adoption / portability.** You migrate *onto* Heroku by writing to its conventions; leaving is a rewrite. HoBo's **`hobo import`** adopts existing TF/Pulumi/FaaS estates **in place** ([ADR-0041](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0041)).

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** Heroku is a **closed, single-cloud, commercially-monetized managed PaaS** with unmatched maturity and ecosystem; HoBo is an **open, multi-cloud, IfC + event-sourced + AI-native control plane** you can self-host. Heroku is the **DX benchmark** for zero-to-deploy and the **origin of the Twelve-Factor conventions** HoBo's config/secrets-as-references model ([ADR-0027](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0027)) inherits — but it maps one app onto *Heroku's own AWS*, whereas HoBo maps one description onto *any mix of providers*. Heroku's frozen roadmap is the sharpest argument for HoBo's OSS/self-host stance.
- **vs Encore/Nitric:** those are **infrastructure-from-code** frameworks that deploy into *your* cloud; Heroku is the **managed-PaaS incumbent** they explicitly position against on portability and lock-in. Heroku wins on ecosystem/maturity; loses on cloud-agnosticism, IfC, and open-source.
- **vs Render / Railway / Fly.io:** the modern "Heroku successors" compete on price and (Fly) edge/regions; they inherit Heroku's DX vocabulary. HoBo is a different layer — a **meta-cloud control plane**, not another opinionated PaaS runtime.
- **vs Kubernetes/PaaS-on-K8s:** Fir *is* Heroku-on-Kubernetes, but it hides K8s entirely; HoBo orchestrates provisioning across substrates (including K8s via Crossplane) rather than being one runtime.
- **vs Convex/Supabase:** managed backends with a vendor runtime; Heroku is more general-purpose (any process type) but equally a hosted, closed runtime.

**Net:** Heroku is the **most mature and polished platform in this comparison and the one HoBo owes its DX vocabulary to** — but it is **closed-source, single-cloud (Heroku-operated AWS), commercially monetized, and now roadmap-frozen**. HoBo's differentiation is the **entire axis Heroku sits on the far side of**: open-source + self-hostable, cloud-agnostic with pluggable IaC, infrastructure-from-code with typed `.allow()` wiring, an event-sourced durable runtime, a polyglot wasm/WIT contract, platform-rules (Resource Definitions/Matching + Dispatcher), and agents-as-principals — while deliberately **not** replicating Heroku's commercial-monetization machinery (dyno pricing, metered add-on marketplace, revenue share).

### The one-line takeaway

**Heroku is the platform HoBo owes its developer-experience vocabulary to** — `git push`-to-deploy, dynos, buildpacks, add-ons, config vars, Twelve-Factor — and it remains **the most mature, ecosystem-rich, operationally proven product in this set**. But it is **closed-source, locked to Heroku-operated AWS, commercially monetized, and (since Feb 2026) roadmap-frozen by Salesforce**. HoBo's opening is the whole axis Heroku sits opposite: **open-source + self-hostable, cloud-agnostic with pluggable IaC, infrastructure-from-code with typed `.allow()` wiring, an event-sourced durable runtime, a polyglot wasm/WIT contract, platform-rules (Resource Definitions/Matching + Dispatcher), and agents-as-principals** — while treating Heroku's dyno pricing, metered add-on marketplace, and revenue share as **✗-by-design non-goals ([ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064))**, not gaps to close.
