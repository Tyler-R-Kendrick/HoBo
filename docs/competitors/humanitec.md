# Humanitec — Competitor Reference

> Captured for HoBo competitive analysis (research as of 2026). This documents **Humanitec's Platform Orchestrator** faithfully; the HoBo↔Humanitec parity tracker lives in the [HoBo mapping](#hobo-mapping) section below.

## What it is

The **Platform Orchestrator** is a cloud-agnostic, multi-compute orchestration engine that powers **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)**. Developers describe a workload in **Score** (environment-agnostic); platform engineers author **Resource Definitions** (how resources get provisioned); the Orchestrator **dynamically generates** environment-specific configuration at deploy time, enforcing standards and policy without the developer touching the details. It is *not* a portal, *not* CI/CD, *not* IaC, *not* monitoring — it is the configuration engine at the heart of an IDP. The framing: "developers describe *what*, the platform decides *how*."

Two audiences share it: developers (who write Score) and platform engineers (who write Resource Definitions). Within the common IDP "5-plane" reference architecture — Developer Control Plane (workload specs, portals), Integration & Delivery Plane (CI, registries, the Orchestrator, CD), Resource Plane (clusters, DBs, storage, DNS, VMs, serverless), Monitoring & Logging, and Security — the Orchestrator sits in plane 2 and drives plane 3.

The core mental model is **Read → Match → Create → Deploy**: read developer intent (Score) plus platform config (Resource Definitions); match the needed resource to context (`env_type`, `app`, `env`, `resource_class`, `resource_id`); select the best Resource Definition by specificity score; build a Resource Graph (DAG); execute Drivers; and record an immutable Deployment Set plus a Delta. The single source of truth is Score (*what*) combined with Resource Definitions (*how*). The current generation is compute-agnostic — "any compute, any cloud," meaning VMs, Kubernetes, serverless, or anything Terraform/OpenTofu can manage — while retaining the projects/environments/resource-graph abstractions.

## Feature surface

### Score — the workload spec (developer intent)

Score is an open, platform-agnostic workload spec (CNCF Sandbox, created by Humanitec). Developers write `score.yaml` once, specifying containers, service ports, and abstract resource dependencies; the same file deploys to any environment unchanged.

```yaml
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1
metadata:
  name: my-app
containers:
  my-container:
    image: my-app:latest
    variables:
      DATABASE_URL: "postgres://${resources.db.username}:${resources.db.password}@${resources.db.host}:${resources.db.port}/${resources.db.name}"
    resources:
      limits: { cpu: "0.5", memory: "512Mi" }
      requests: { cpu: "0.1", memory: "128Mi" }
service:
  ports:
    http: { port: 8080, targetPort: 3001 }
resources:
  db:    { type: postgres, class: standard, id: shared.primary }
  dns:   { type: dns }
  s3:    { type: s3, class: private, id: data-bucket }
```

A companion `humanitec.score.yaml` carries Humanitec-specific extensions (workload profile, annotations, overrides).

### Resource Definitions and Matching

A **Resource Definition** is the platform-engineer-authored rule for an abstract `type` (plus optional `class`): which **driver** runs, what **inputs** it gets, and the **matching criteria** that select this definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: entity.humanitec.io/v1b1
kind: Definition
metadata: { id: postgres-prod-ha }
entity:
  name: postgres-prod-ha
  type: postgres
  driver_type: humanitec/terraform
  driver_inputs:
    values:
      tf_code: |
        resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
          identifier     = "${context.app.id}-${context.env.id}-db"
          engine         = "postgres"
          instance_class = "db.r6g.large"
          multi_az       = true
        }
        output "host" { value = aws_db_instance.main.address }
  criteria:
    - env_type: production
      resource_class: high-availability
```

For a needed resource in context `{env_type, app_id, env_id, resource_type, resource_class, resource_id}`, the Orchestrator gathers all definitions of that type, evaluates each definition's criteria, **scores by specificity**, and selects the highest. All listed fields in a criterion must match; the most specific wins; ties break to the next-most-specific.

```yaml
- {}                                                  # score 0 (catch-all)
- env_type: production                                # score 1
- env_type: production, resource_class: ha            # score 2
- env_type: production, app_id: critical, resource_class: ha  # score 3 (wins)
```

### Resource Graph (DAG)

Each deployment produces a DAG whose nodes are resource instances and whose edges are dependencies:

- **Implicit resources** (auto-provisioned scaffolding): `workload`, `base-env`, `k8s-cluster`, `k8s-namespace`.
- **Dependent resources**: those Score requests.
- **Co-provisioned resources**: extra resources a single Resource Definition provisions together (e.g. an S3 bucket plus its IAM policy), including the edges between them.

Resources are identified by the triple **`(type, class, id)`**; shared resources use `id: shared.<name>` and are provisioned once, then reused across workloads. References create edges and flow outputs — `${resources.postgres.standard#shared.primary.outputs.host}`. The graph is topologically ordered; independent nodes provision in parallel; retries are idempotent (≈2). Placeholders span context (`${context.app.id}`, `${context.env.id}`, `${context.env.type}`, `${context.res.id}`, `${context.res.class}`, `${context.res.type}`), resource outputs (`${resources.<type>.<class>#<id>.outputs.<name>}`), and implicit values (`${implicit.k8s.namespace}`).

Resource lifecycle distinguishes an **active resource** (a real provisioned object — RDS instance, bucket, namespace — whose driver keeps state across runs), a **shared resource** (`shared.<name>`, one active resource deduped by `(type,class,id)` and reused across workloads in an environment), and **implicit resources** (the auto scaffolding above).

### Drivers, Resource Packs, and Workload Profiles

A **Driver** provisions a resource given a Resource Definition's inputs plus context, returning outputs and optionally Kubernetes manifests. Drivers are the core extension point and the mechanism that keeps Humanitec IaC-agnostic — Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, or anything HTTP-callable.

| Driver | `driver_type` | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Terraform** | `humanitec/terraform` | Runs Terraform/OpenTofu (inline `tf_code` or Git module); manages state; any TF provider. GA. |
| **Template** | `humanitec/template` | Renders Go templates → Kubernetes manifests (Namespace, Service, Ingress, CRDs, quotas…). |
| **Echo** | `humanitec/echo` | Passes inputs through as outputs unchanged — for **externally-managed** resources Humanitec reads but does not provision. |
| **Container** | `humanitec/container` | Runs a K8s Job for complex/custom provisioning (Pulumi, CloudFormation, scripts); a sidecar `outputs-fetcher` reads the outputs JSON. |
| **Custom (webhook)** | `custom/<name>` | Calls a self-hosted HTTP service (signed JWT payload); returns outputs JSON plus optional manifests. Any tech stack. |

The driver interface is conceptually a PUT/DELETE contract — input (context + driver inputs + old state) in, outputs (and optional manifests) out:

```json
{ "context": {"app_id":"my-app","env_id":"prod","env_type":"production",
              "res_id":"shared.primary","res_type":"postgres","res_class":"ha"},
  "driver_inputs": {"tf_code":"...","instance_class":"db.r6g.large"},
  "old_state": { } }
```

```json
{ "outputs": {"host":"...","port":5432,"username":"...","password":"...","connection_string":"..."},
  "manifests": [ { "apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Secret", "...":"..." } ] }
```

Custom drivers register with type, JSON input-schema, URL, and supported account credentials. Humanitec publishes an open-source driver library (AWS/GCP/Azure) plus community contributions. **Resource Packs** are pre-built collections of Resource Definitions for common use cases (AWS, GCP, Azure, in-cluster), typically using the Terraform or Template driver, imported into an org and customized via matching criteria (marketplace at humanitec.com/marketplace). **Workload Profiles** template *how a workload is realized* — Kubernetes Deployment vs serverless vs batch job; the built-in `container` profile is the default, custom profiles come from a spec plus Helm chart, and the selected profile shapes the produced manifests (enabling Dapr services, gRPC servers, batch jobs, etc.).

### Applications, Environments, and lifecycle

An **Application** is a logical grouping of workloads plus shared resources (org-level). An **Environment** is an instance of an app with its own config, carrying an **Environment Type** (`development`/`staging`/`production`/custom) that is the primary matching dimension. A new environment can be **cloned** from one with a prior successful deployment (creating a draft Delta). **Ephemeral / dynamic environments** are per-PR/feature, created and torn down via CI; platform engineers map cheap variants (in-cluster DB, serverless) to ephemeral environments through matching.

Deployment state is captured as two artifacts. A **Deployment Set** is an immutable, complete configuration snapshot (`modules` + `shared`) for an app at a point in time. A **Deployment Delta** is a mutable draft diff (create/update/delete of modules and resources) applied to a Set, combinable and reviewable before committing. The flow: Score → generate **Delta** → review/approve → apply to create a new **Set** → execute drivers → record an immutable Deployment (the audit trail). **Rollback** re-applies a previous Deployment's Set and graph (stateful resources keep state); **incremental deployments** update only changed resources.

The CLI is `humctl`:

```bash
humctl score deploy -f score.yaml --org O --app A --env prod --image my-app:v1 --message "..." --wait
humctl deploy delta <DELTA_ID> <ENV> --app A
humctl create env <ENV> --type production --from <SRC_ENV>   # clone
humctl rollback <ENV> --app A
humctl get deployments --app A --env prod
humctl describe environment --app A --env prod               # resource graph
humctl apply -f resource-definition.yaml
```

The REST API base is `https://api.humanitec.dev` (Bearer token), with endpoints for orgs/apps/envs/deploys/definitions/logs. A Terraform provider (`humanitec/humanitec`) manages Humanitec resources as IaC.

### Portal and developer self-service

The Portal is a web UI atop the Orchestrator: self-service environments and deployments, app status, resource-graph visualization, and drift detection; platform engineers do resource management and setup here. It offers **golden paths / paved roads** (platform rules developers follow declaratively via Score), service catalogs, dashboards, self-service templates/scaffolding, **scorecards** (health/compliance, DORA metrics), RBAC, and automated docs/audit. The Portal is **optional and modular** — teams can use the API/CLI or other portals (Backstage, Port.io) instead. Humanitec frames the split cleanly: the Orchestrator is the engine; the portal is one surface.

### Connectivity — Agent and Operator

The **Humanitec Agent** is a lightweight proxy inside the customer's private network so the **SaaS** Orchestrator can deploy into **private/air-gapped** clusters **without inbound access**. It opens an **outbound TCP 443** reverse tunnel to Humanitec — no open ports or exposed endpoints — TLS-encrypted and authenticated, with credentials staying in-network; the Orchestrator never connects directly to private clusters, proxying everything through the Agent. Installed as a K8s agent, one Agent can manage multiple clusters (private K8s, multi-region/multi-cloud, regulated/air-gapped), and it also enables a GitOps mode where the Agent pulls runtime data.

The **Humanitec Operator** is separate from the Agent: a K8s operator on each cluster (public or private) that manages CRDs and provisions **Secrets** from secret stores. It is a Helm-installed controller-manager that acts on resource changes.

### CI/CD, Pipelines, and GitOps

Humanitec works with **any** CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Bitbucket, CircleCI, Jenkins, Codefresh). The pattern: CI builds an image → notifies the Orchestrator of the new artifact → the Orchestrator deploys (via `humctl score deploy --image <ver>` or a webhook, using a service-user token). **Humanitec Pipelines** add multi-step deployment workflows triggered by a **Deployment Request** (new artifacts matching criteria) or the **API**. **Deployment rules** are if-then (e.g. "new image from dev HEAD → deploy dev-testing") with flexible image matching/exclusion; jobs run in parallel with `needs` for ordering, capped at ~10 concurrent runs, with custom `concurrency` locks; they can integrate policy checks, sign-offs, and Slack/Teams notifications. In **GitOps mode**, the Orchestrator writes the Resource Graph as K8s Custom Resources to a Git repo/branch and ArgoCD/Flux sync to clusters — standalone or hybrid.

Deployment targets are Kubernetes-centric (EKS/GKE/AKS/on-prem/private). Cloud resources come via the **Terraform driver** (any TF provider), **Template driver** (K8s), and **Container driver** (Pulumi/CFN/custom). The "any compute" direction extends to VMs and serverless, but K8s remains primary and native serverless (Cloud Run/Lambda as primary compute) is limited.

### Governance, secrets, and observability

**RBAC** operates at **Organization / Application / Environment-Type** levels, least-privilege by default, with roles like admin/developer/ops/delivery-manager/approver/viewer. **Approvals and sign-offs** run via Pipelines and webhooks (e.g. notify Slack pre-prod, delivery manager confirms prod), and policy checks run automatically pre-deploy — standardization by design (devs declare *what*, the platform enforces *how*).

**Secrets** are a resource type whose outputs inject into containers at runtime, never logged or persisted in manifests/Git; stores include **Vault** (KV v2, dynamic creds), **Azure Key Vault**, **Infisical**, and **native K8s**, with shared values/secrets scoped to app/environment with overrides.

For observability and audit, a deployment-status tab shows the active deployment plus workloads and shared resources; resource-status health comes via the Operator; plan-only and historical resource graphs are available. **Drift detection** (via the TF provider) compares desired (graph) against actual and alerts on config drift. Scorecards and DORA metrics ship in the Portal, and external monitoring (Prometheus/Datadog) integrates through resource definitions — Humanitec is not a full observability platform. The **audit log** records every API change on every entity (who/when/action), with min **365-day** immutable retention, but **no request bodies and no IPs**, and up to a ~5-min delay.

### Extensibility and API

Drivers are the core extension (HTTP PUT/DELETE implementing the driver interface; any stack; embedding TF/Pulumi/CFN/custom). Resource Packs bundle definitions; the open-source driver library seeds them. The REST API covers all entities; **webhooks** fire on env create/delete and deploy start/complete with customizable payloads and variable substitution; the Terraform provider manages Humanitec as IaC; and **MCP** support lets AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT) drive the Orchestrator directly.

### Editions and pricing

- **SaaS (cloud-hosted):** fully managed, multi-tenant; uses the Agent for private-cluster access.
- **Self-hosted:** the entire Orchestrator on customer infra — data sovereignty, **air-gapped** support, regulated industries (banking/insurance/gov/defense), GovCloud/sovereign clouds.
- **Free / community:** a free trial (no card); a free community version is mentioned (limits not fully public).
- **Pricing:** not publicly disclosed — demo/contact required, an adoption and comparison friction point.

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what is genuinely strong)

1. **Dynamic configuration management** — Score (intent) + Resource Definitions (rules) + **Matching** → environment-specific config generated at deploy time. The cleanest dev-vs-platform separation in the market.
2. **Resource Graph** — a real, queryable DAG of app + infra with co-provisioning and output flow; topologically executed.
3. **Driver model** — IaC-agnostic execution (terraform/template/echo/container/custom-webhook); extend by HTTP.
4. **Deployment Sets + Deltas** — immutable snapshots plus mutable diffs → clean promote/rollback/preview and incremental deploys.
5. **Governance** — RBAC (org/app/env-type), approval workflows, drift detection, immutable audit.
6. **Enterprise reach** — SaaS + self-hosted + air-gapped; the Agent for private networks; regulated/sovereign markets.
7. **Ecosystem** — Resource Packs, the open Score spec, a Terraform provider, open-source drivers, and MCP for AI agents.

### Positioning against adjacent tools (Humanitec's framing)

- **vs Backstage** — complementary, not competitive. Backstage is a developer **portal** (catalog/scaffolding, OSS framework); Humanitec is the **backend orchestrator** (config generation, provisioning). "Deploy Humanitec first, layer Backstage on top"; Humanitec argues Backstage is framework-heavy DIY.
- **vs Terraform / Pulumi** — Humanitec is the **orchestration layer above** IaC: it orchestrates and standardizes TF execution via drivers (declarative, policy-driven) rather than replacing it.
- **vs Crossplane** — Crossplane is a K8s-native control plane (CRDs); Humanitec is broader app+infra orchestration that does not require modeling everything as K8s CRDs.
- **vs ArgoCD / Flux** — GitOps operators sync Git→cluster; Humanitec **generates** what to sync (and adds multi-stage workflows, approvals, policy), then can hand off to Argo/Flux.
- **vs Qovery / Northflank / Nitric** — those are simpler PaaS/serverless-first; Humanitec is enterprise-grade orchestration with deep policy/governance and a single app+infra graph (more upfront config, more control).

### Gaps (HoBo's openings)

1. **K8s-centric; weak serverless** — no first-class Cloud Run/Lambda compute → HoBo leads with **wasm components + OCI fallback**, polyglot.
2. **Steep learning curve** — many interlocking concepts (Resource Types/Definitions/Drivers/Runners/Manifests), and docs lag features → HoBo's **IfC-default** authoring plus mapping-as-sugar keeps the simple path simple.
3. **Opaque pricing + proprietary core** → HoBo ships an **OSS core**, self-host = hosted.
4. **Opaque matching selection** — no first-class "why this infra" audit → HoBo records **`match.Decided`** events, replayable.
5. **No event-sourcing/replay/time-travel** → HoBo's core is event-sourced (audit + DR + run inspector).
6. **Human-authored Resource Definitions/Packs** → HoBo's **generation pipeline** can AI-generate definitions and packs, gated by conformance.
7. **Not a full observability platform** → HoBo bundles run inspector/traces/replay.
8. **Vendor lock-in (Manifests)**, though Score is open → HoBo ports are **WIT interfaces** (standards-based); Score is importable for interop.

> Net: Humanitec proves the orchestrator abstraction and governance; HoBo adopts that engine and adds a polyglot wasm runtime, event-sourced auditability, AI-native generation, and OSS openness. Because Humanitec is mature, enterprise-grade, and now explicitly AI-first, HoBo cannot win on "AI-native" alone — it must combine Humanitec's best engine (Resource Definitions + Matching, drivers, sets/deltas, governance) with what Humanitec lacks: a wasm-first polyglot runtime, event-sourced replay/time-travel plus auditable matching decisions, AI-generated definitions/implementations, IfC-default simplicity, and an OSS core.

### Open parity items (iteration hooks)

- Resource Definition authoring surface: TS (typed) vs YAML (Humanitec-parity) vs both.
- Whether `echo`/BYO resources participate in drift/reconcile or are read-only.
- Agent transport + multi-cluster routing details.
- Matching scoring exactly mirroring Humanitec vs a HoBo refinement (explicit priorities).
