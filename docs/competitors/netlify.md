# Netlify — competitor reference

> A faithful, detailed capture of **Netlify** for HoBo competitive analysis. Netlify is a **shipping Jamstack / composable-web leader** — the vendor that coined "Jamstack," with a mature Git→build→edge pipeline, polished Deploy Previews, and a real global edge network — where HoBo is still **design-phase**. The overlap is narrow but real: Netlify's frontend hosting, Functions, Edge Functions, Blobs, and Netlify DB map onto HoBo catalog ports, and Netlify's 2025 **Agent Runners** move onto the same AI-native turf. But Netlify is **frontend/composable-web-centric on its own single-vendor cloud**; HoBo is **backend/infra-control-plane, multi-cloud, wasm-default, self-hostable**.

## What it is

Netlify is a **frontend cloud / composable-web platform** — a hosted, Git-driven pipeline that builds your frontend on every push, deploys it to a **global edge network (100+ locations)**, and layers on serverless **Functions** (AWS Lambda; JS/TS/Go), **Edge Functions** (Deno), and first-party primitives (**Blobs**, **Netlify DB** — Neon Postgres, **Forms**, **Identity**, **Redirects**). Every push to a connected repo fires an automatic build + deploy; **every pull request gets its own unique preview URL** — a live staging environment with no manual setup. HTTPS, DDoS protection, and auto-scaling are on by default.

Netlify **coined "Jamstack"** and now positions around the **Composable Web Platform**, three products: **Netlify Core** (the frontend cloud — build/deploy/edge/functions), **Netlify Connect** (a GraphQL **data-unification** layer over your CMS/commerce/other sources), and **Netlify Create** (a visual editor). Its thesis is *composable architecture* — assemble a site from decoupled best-of-breed services behind a unified frontend and data layer, deployed and previewed as one.

Unlike the infrastructure-from-code analogs (Encore, Nitric) that provision into **your** AWS/GCP, **Netlify is its own single-vendor cloud**: you do not bring a cloud account, and there is **no self-host**. That is the deepest structural contrast with HoBo. In 2025 Netlify pivoted hard toward AI — **Agent Runners** (run Claude Code / OpenAI Codex / Google Gemini against a live project from the dashboard), an **AI Gateway** (beta), and Netlify DB explicitly framed "for AI-native development" — and moved billing to a **credit-based** usage model that meters deploys, bandwidth, compute, and requests.

## Feature surface

### Build & deploy — the Git-driven pipeline

The core loop: connect a Git repo (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure DevOps), and **every push triggers a build + atomic deploy**; **every pull request gets a unique Deploy Preview URL**. Builds run Netlify's build image (framework auto-detection, Build Plugins, the `@netlify/*` build system) and publish an immutable versioned deploy to the CDN, so rollback is instant (repoint to a prior immutable deploy). **Deploy contexts** — `production`, `deploy-preview`, `branch-deploy`, `dev` — let build command/env/publish differ per context.

### `netlify.toml` — file-based config

Config lives in `netlify.toml` at repo root; file settings override UI settings. The real shape (quoted from the docs):

```toml
[build]
  base = "project/"
  publish = "build-output/"
  command = "npm run build"
  [build.environment]
    NODE_VERSION = "20"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions/"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  external_node_modules = ["package-1"]
  included_files = ["files/*.md"]

[[edge_functions]]
  path = "/*"
  function = "auth"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://backend.example.com/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  NOT_PRIVATE_ITEM = "not so secret"

[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "echo branch"

[dev]
  command = "npm start"
  targetPort = 3000
  port = 8888

[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-example"
```

Note: `[[redirects]]` and `[[headers]]` are **global** (cannot be scoped to a context); `netlify.toml` has **no env-var substitution** except signed proxy redirects.

### Functions (serverless) & Edge Functions (Deno)

**Functions** are serverless HTTP/event handlers on **AWS Lambda** (JS/TS/Go; Lambda-compatible API for legacy `event/context` handlers). They live in `netlify/functions/`, and the modern shape uses Web-standard `Request`/`Response` plus a `Config` export for routing:

```typescript
import type { Config, Context } from "@netlify/functions"

export default async (req: Request, context: Context) => {
  return new Response("Hello, world!")
}

export const config: Config = { path: "/hello" }
```

Function flavors: **web request**, **background** (async, long-running), **scheduled** (cron), and **streaming**, plus platform-event handlers (e.g. `deploySucceeded`).

**Edge Functions** run in a **Deno** runtime (built on Deno; web-standard APIs, `node:`-prefixed Node built-ins, URL-imported Deno modules, npm in beta) at the edge with sub-30ms cold starts — ideal for auth checks, personalization, and geo redirects. Signature is `(request, context)`; declared inline via `export const config` or in `netlify.toml` `[[edge_functions]]` (multiple on one path run top-to-bottom):

```typescript
import type { Config, Context } from "@netlify/edge-functions";

export default async (req: Request, { cookies, geo }: Context) => {
  if (geo.city === "Paris" && cookies.get("promo-code") === "15-for-followers") {
    return Response.redirect(new URL("/subscriber-sale", req.url));
  }
};
export const config: Config = { path: "/" };
```

`Context` exposes `next()` (chain), `geo`, `cookies`, `params`, `requestId`, `site`, `deploy`, `server.region`, and `waitUntil()`. Returning a `Response` serves directly; a `URL` rewrites; `undefined` passes through.

### Data & storage — Blobs + Netlify DB (Neon)

**Netlify Blobs** — a zero-config, highly-available **key/value + unstructured/blob** store ("optimized for frequent reads and infrequent writes"), usable as a simple KV or basic database:

```javascript
import { getStore } from "@netlify/blobs";
const uploads = getStore("file-uploads");
await uploads.set(key, file, { metadata: { country } });
await uploads.setJSON(key, { hello: "world" });
const val = await uploads.get(key, { type: "json" });
await uploads.list({ prefix: "user/" });
```

Consistency is configurable: **eventual** (default; single-region write, edge-cached globally, propagates within ~60s) or **strong** (immediate, slower reads), set per-store or per-op.

**Netlify DB** — "a fully managed Postgres database built into the Netlify platform," **powered by Neon**, with provisioning, **migrations**, and **branching** handled automatically. `netlify db init` (alias of `netlify database init`) instantly provisions an **anonymous Neon** Postgres in a region matching your functions; you get **7 days** to explore before claiming it into a Neon account. Each **Deploy Preview gets its own database branch** with a copy of production data. Query via `@netlify/neon` / `@netlify/database` (or Drizzle ORM). *Available on credit-based plans only; storage free until July 1, 2026.*

### Netlify CLI & local dev

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli    # install
netlify login                 # browser OAuth → access token
netlify init                  # connect repo for continuous deploy
netlify link                  # link local dir to an existing site
netlify dev                   # local: serve site + functions + edge + env injection
netlify build                 # run the production build locally
netlify deploy                # deploy to a draft preview URL
netlify deploy --prod         # deploy to production
netlify env:set KEY value --context production
netlify db init               # provision Netlify DB (Neon)
netlify blobs:get / blobs:set # manage Blobs
```

`netlify dev` boots a local environment that mirrors production — runs your framework dev server, functions, edge functions, redirects, and env injection behind one local port.

### Deploy Previews & collaboration

Every PR/MR produces an isolated **Deploy Preview** at a unique URL — a full live build of that branch, with its own DB branch (Netlify DB), preview-scoped env, and a **Deploy Preview** UI for stakeholder review and **collaboration comments** layered onto the preview. **Branch deploys** publish non-production branches at stable subdomains; **split testing** can route traffic across branches. This per-PR preview polish is a signature Netlify strength.

### The Composable Web Platform (Core / Connect / Create)

- **Netlify Core** — the frontend cloud: build, deploy, edge, functions, storage.
- **Netlify Connect** — a **data-unification layer**: "bring together content from any existing or new data source, and access that data from a single **GraphQL** API." Connectors define a data model; Netlify builds a GraphQL schema, **syncs** source data, and **caches it at the edge** (cache fields drive query caching; responses over 9 KB aren't edge-cached).
- **Netlify Create** — a visual editor for content/marketing teams over the composable stack.

### AI: Agent Runners & AI Gateway

**Agent Runners** (GA Oct 2025) bring **Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini** into the Netlify Dashboard to run against **live** projects — "giving secure access to your Netlify project context, deployment pipeline, build settings, and more." Agents run inside Netlify's infrastructure with access to the **codebase, logs, and deploy pipeline**, plus staging previews, rollback, and role-based log access; multiple runs go in parallel from the dashboard or a deploy-details page. Runs **consume credits** (AI inference + compute). An **AI Gateway** (beta) rounds out the AI workflow surface.

### Forms, Identity, Redirects (first-party primitives)

- **Forms** — add a `netlify` attribute to an HTML `<form>` and Netlify captures submissions automatically (no backend), with spam filtering (honeypot / reCAPTCHA) and notifications.
- **Identity** — Netlify Identity + the underlying **GoTrue** API are **officially deprecated / maintenance-only** (security fixes only; still supported as of Feb 2026 but no new features); Netlify now recommends the **Auth0 extension** as the successor.
- **Redirects / Headers / Proxy rewrites** — declarative rules (`_redirects` / `netlify.toml`) for SPA rewrites, proxies (`status = 200`), role/geo/language conditions, and custom headers.

### Pricing (credit-based)

Netlify moved to a **credit** model: everything (deploys, bandwidth, compute, requests, AI) draws from a monthly credit balance.

- **Free — $0:** 300 credits/mo; deploy from AI/Git/API; unlimited preview deploys; custom domains + SSL; functions, AI models, DB + blob storage, firewall, global CDN.
- **Personal — $9/mo:** 1,000 credits; + secret detection, 1-day observability, priority email.
- **Pro — $20/mo:** 3,000 credits; **unlimited members**; private org repos, shared env vars, 3+ concurrent builds, 30-day analytics.
- **Enterprise — custom:** unlimited credits; 99.99% SLA, enterprise edge tier, high-performance builds, **SSO & SCIM**, log drains, org management, 24/7 support.
- **Metering (illustrative):** production deploys ~15 credits (~$0.10) · bandwidth ~20 credits/GB (~$0.13) · compute ~10 credits/GB-hour · web requests ~2 credits/10k. Top-up credit packs at $5 (500) / $10 (1,500).

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what Netlify does well)

- **Best-in-class frontend/Jamstack DX, shipping at scale** — Git→build→edge with framework auto-detection, immutable atomic deploys, instant rollback, and a build-plugin ecosystem. This is a mature, polished pipeline HoBo has only **designed**.
- **Deploy Previews polish** — per-PR live preview URLs with preview-scoped env, DB branching, and collaboration comments; a category-defining review workflow.
- **A real global edge network (100+ PoPs)** with **Edge Functions on Deno** at sub-30ms cold starts — first-party edge compute HoBo does **not** operate.
- **First-party primitives out of the box** — Blobs, Netlify DB (Neon), Forms, Identity/Redirects — "batteries included" for full-stack frontends without stitching services.
- **Composable Web Platform** — Connect (GraphQL data unification + edge cache) + Create (visual editing) target the enterprise composable-architecture buyer, marketers included.
- **Aggressive AI-native posture, shipping** — Agent Runners put Claude Code/Codex/Gemini on live projects from the dashboard **today**; Netlify DB is pitched for AI-native development.

### Gaps (Netlify's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **Single-vendor cloud — no self-host, no BYO-cloud, no multi-cloud.** Everything runs on **Netlify's** infrastructure; you cannot deploy into your own AWS/GCP/Azure, cannot self-host, and cannot pin resources to specific providers. HoBo is **multi-cloud + IaC-agnostic** (Pulumi/Crossplane/TF/OpenTofu adapters) with typed provider-native escape hatches ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)/[ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)), and **self-host = hosted** (Yard-is-a-Bindle, [Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)).
- **Frontend/composable-web-centric, not a backend control plane.** The compute story is FaaS (Lambda) + edge (Deno); there is **no durable/event-sourced runtime, no actors/workflows/sagas, no replay/audit**. HoBo's core is a **durable event-sourced runtime** with actors + workflows + choreography sagas ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11)/[ADR-0050](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0050)).
- **Language-bound compute.** Functions = JS/TS/Go on Lambda; Edge Functions = Deno (JS/TS). No polyglot-via-components. HoBo's runtime contract is **language-neutral WIT** (any wasm-compiling language, [Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)/[ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)).
- **Narrow data model.** Blobs (KV/blob) + Netlify DB (Postgres via Neon) — no first-class document/graph/vector/wide-column/OLAP paradigm resource. HoBo formalizes a **paradigm taxonomy** + opt-in packages `@hobo/sql`/`vector`/`graph`/`document` ([ADR-0052/0081](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md)).
- **No platform-rules layer.** Fixed vendor mapping; no "same app, different realization per environment, auditably." HoBo adds **Resource Definitions + Matching** (`match.Decided`) + the cost-aware **Dispatcher** ([Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25)/[ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)/[ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)).
- **No agents-as-principals / brokered-token identity model.** Agent Runners **run** coding agents in-dashboard, but agents are not first-class **identities** with scoped, brokered, audited capabilities. HoBo makes **agents principals** with SVIDs + MCP control surface + brokered tokens ([Plan 6](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)).
- **No AI-generated providers / trainable functions.** The AI story is *agents editing your repo*, not a **generation pipeline** that authors + conformance-gates providers/impls, nor self-optimizing semantic functions. HoBo's generation pipeline generates adapters + UI ([Plan 23](../design/generated-stack.md#plan-23)/[ADR-0010](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0010)/[ADR-0056](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0056)).
- **Identity is deprecated** (GoTrue maintenance-only → Auth0); the built-in auth primitive is a legacy path, not a strategic one.
- **Usage-metered credit billing is the business model.** Deploys, bandwidth, compute, requests, and AI all draw credits — spend scales with success. HoBo has **no billing by design** ([ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)); metering is OSS **FinOps showback**, never invoicing ([ADR-0039](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md)).

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** Netlify is **frontend/composable-web on its own single-vendor cloud, shipping, polished**; HoBo is a **backend/infra control plane — multi-cloud, wasm-default, event-sourced, self-hostable, AI-native**, still in design. Overlap is a thin band (frontend hosting, functions, edge, blobs, sql, agent moves); the divergence is the whole platform shape. On the overlap, **Netlify is ahead today** (build pipeline, Deploy Previews, edge at scale); on the surrounding system, HoBo's design is broader.
- **vs Vercel:** the closest rival — both are frontend clouds with Git→edge pipelines. Netlify differentiates on first-party primitives (Blobs/DB/Forms/Identity), Connect's data unification, and Deno-based Edge Functions; Vercel leans Next.js-native + its own edge.
- **vs Encore / Nitric:** those are **infrastructure-from-code into your AWS/GCP/Azure**; Netlify is the opposite — **its own cloud, no BYO**. HoBo sits with Encore/Nitric on multi-cloud/BYO and IfC authoring, against Netlify's single-vendor model.
- **vs Convex / Supabase:** managed backends with their own primitives; Netlify is frontend-first with backend primitives bolted alongside. All three are single-vendor clouds where HoBo is multi-cloud + self-host.
- **vs Cloudflare:** both run edge networks with edge compute + KV/blob + DB; Cloudflare is infra/edge-primitive-centric, Netlify is frontend-DX-centric. Neither is multi-cloud or self-hostable the way HoBo is.

**Net:** Netlify is the **shipping frontend/composable-web leader** and a genuine reminder that on the overlap — build pipeline, Deploy Previews, edge functions at scale, Jamstack DX — it is **ahead of design-phase HoBo today**. But Netlify is **frontend/composable-web-centric, single-vendor cloud, language-bound, usage-billed**; HoBo is **backend/infra-control-plane, multi-cloud + pluggable-IaC, wasm-polyglot, event-sourced + governed, self-hostable, and billing-free by design**. The competitive line is not "who builds frontends better" (Netlify wins) but "who controls infrastructure across clouds with a durable runtime and AI-native governance" (HoBo's bet).

### The one-line takeaway

**Netlify proves the frontend/composable-web pipeline in production — and on the overlap (build, Deploy Previews, edge functions, Jamstack DX) it is ahead of design-phase HoBo today.** But Netlify is bounded to **its own single-vendor cloud, language-bound compute, a narrow data model, and a usage-metered credit business**. HoBo's differentiation is orthogonal: **backend/infra control plane across many clouds + pluggable IaC, a language-neutral wasm runtime, a durable event-sourced runtime with actors/workflows/sagas, a broad data-paradigm catalog, agents-as-principals + a generation pipeline, self-host = hosted, and no billing by design.** The two barely compete on frontends; they compete on **who owns the infrastructure control plane**.
