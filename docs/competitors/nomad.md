# HashiCorp Nomad + Nomad Pack — Competitor Reference

> Captured for HoBo competitive analysis. Sources: HashiCorp Developer Nomad docs and the `hashicorp/nomad-pack` repository, researched July 1, 2026. This file documents **Nomad** and **Nomad Pack** faithfully; the HoBo↔Nomad mapping/parity tracker lives in the [HoBo mapping](#hobo-mapping) section below.

## Positioning

- **Nomad:** a simple, flexible scheduler/orchestrator for containers, binaries, batch jobs, and other workloads across on-prem and cloud infrastructure.
- **Nomad Pack:** a templating/packaging layer for Nomad job specifications: deploy popular apps, reuse internal patterns, and share jobspecs through registries.
- **Paradigm:** operations-first workload orchestration. Developers or platform teams submit HCL jobspecs; Nomad schedules allocations onto client nodes and manages lifecycle, placement, networking, service registration, and rollout behavior.
- **Target user:** infrastructure/platform teams that want a lighter-weight alternative or complement to Kubernetes, especially for mixed workloads: Docker, raw executables, Java, QEMU, batch, system jobs, and legacy services.
- **Relation to HoBo:** direct competition at the **scheduler/runtime/control-plane** layer, especially when paired with Nomad Pack as the reusable app packaging story. It is not an Infrastructure-from-Code platform like Nitric; it is a programmable workload fabric HoBo could either compete with or target as a provider/host adapter (dispositioned accepted-future in [ADR-0106](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0106)).

## Architecture

```text
Nomad jobspec / Nomad Pack
  → Nomad HTTP API / CLI
  → Nomad server cluster (Raft state, scheduling, evaluations, deployments)
  → Nomad client agents (drivers, task lifecycle, alloc dirs, networking)
  → task drivers (docker, exec, raw_exec, java, qemu, custom plugins)
  → integrations (Consul service discovery/mesh, Vault, CNI, CSI, autoscaler)
```

**Core hierarchy.** A Nomad **job** contains one or more **groups**; each group contains one or more **tasks**. Groups are placement units: tasks in a group are co-located on the same client. A running placement is an **allocation**.

**Scheduling model.** Jobs are submitted to servers; servers produce evaluations and placement plans; clients run allocations through task drivers. Placement can be shaped with datacenters, regions, node pools, constraints, affinities, spreads, priorities, reschedule/restart policies, and resource reservations.

**Workload types.** Nomad covers service jobs, batch jobs, system jobs, parameterized/on-demand jobs, periodic jobs, and dispatch-style runs. This is broader than serverless-backend frameworks: Nomad is a general scheduler.

**Integration-first, not batteries-included cloud resources.** Nomad intentionally delegates service mesh/discovery to Consul, secrets to Vault or Nomad Variables/templates, storage to CSI/host volumes, networking to CNI/host networking, autoscaling to Nomad Autoscaler, and infrastructure provisioning to external IaC/cluster management.

## Feature surface

### Jobspec model

| Surface                                      | What Nomad provides                                                                                                                                                   | HoBo-relevant reading                                                      |

| `service`                                    | Registers services with Nomad or Consul; supports health checks, tags/meta, canary tags/meta, Connect sidecars/gateways, workload identity for Consul service tokens. | Strong service-discovery + rollout integration.                            |
| `network`                                    | Dynamic/static port allocation, host/bridge/CNI modes, port labels, DNS.                                                                                              | Good low-level networking control.                                         |
| `resources`                                  | CPU, memory, memory max, device resources (e.g. GPU through device plugins).                                                                                          | Scheduler resource constraints, not app-level resource ports.              |
| `template`                                   | Renders config/env/files from variables, Consul KV, Vault secrets; can signal/restart tasks on change.                                                                | Powerful config injection but not parse-don't-validate typed domain input. |
| `artifact`                                   | Downloads artifacts before task start.                                                                                                                                | Useful legacy/binary deployment path.                                      |

### Workload drivers

| Driver class        | Typical use                      | Competitive note                                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker              | Container workloads.             | Kubernetes-like container hosting without Kubernetes API complexity.                    |
| Exec/raw exec       | Binaries and scripts.            | Stronger legacy/non-container story than many PaaS/serverless systems.                  |
| Java                | JVM workloads.                   | Legacy enterprise fit.                                                                  |
| QEMU                | VM-like workloads.               | Bridges container and VM scheduling.                                                    |
| Custom task drivers | Plugin-defined runtimes/devices. | Extensible, but operator-authored plugin path rather than HoBo's WIT-conformance model. |

### Service discovery, mesh, and networking

Nomad can register services into either Nomad's native service discovery or Consul. Service blocks may live at task or group level, include TCP/HTTP checks for the Nomad provider, and expose richer Consul options such as gRPC/script checks, Connect service mesh sidecars, ingress/terminating/mesh gateways, tags/meta, weighted DNS, canary metadata, and workload identity for Consul service tokens.

**Lifecycle nuance:** service/check updates can be applied without restarting a task; during task shutdown Nomad deregisters services first, optionally waits for `shutdown_delay`, then signals/kills the task. That gives Nomad an operations-grade traffic-draining story.

### Security, identity, and secrets

| Surface           | Nomad capability                                                                                                         | HoBo comparison cue                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ACLs              | Namespaces, policies, roles/tokens, scoped capabilities for jobs, nodes, variables, plugins, exec, etc.                  | Mature operator RBAC; HoBo needs equivalent project/Yard/Camp RBAC plus agent principals.      |
| Workload Identity | JWT identity for tasks/services; current Vault/Consul integrations use workload identity rather than static tokens.      | Close to HoBo's workload identity direction, but not agent-native by default.                  |
| Nomad Variables   | Encrypted configuration data in Nomad state; path-scoped ACLs; task identity grants automatic access to job-owned paths. | Convenient built-in config/secret-ish store, though Vault remains the HashiCorp secret system. |
| Vault integration | Templates and task auth to Vault through workload identity.                                                              | Strong secret story when the HashiCorp stack is present.                                       |
| Consul identity   | Service registration/mesh can obtain Consul tokens via workload identity.                                                | Strong service identity when Consul is present.                                                |
| Sentinel policies | Enterprise policy enforcement on job submission.                                                                         | Comparable to HoBo policy gates, but commercial/enterprise-bound.                              |

### Scheduling, rollout, and operations

- **Regions/datacenters/federation:** clusters can be region-aware; multi-region federation lets users submit jobs or interact with APIs from any attached region.
- **Node pools:** partition clients for workload classes/tenancy/placement.
- **Constraints/affinities/spread:** hard and soft placement, distribution across attributes, zones, racks, node metadata, class, kernel, cloud attributes, etc.
- **Resource-aware scheduling:** CPU/memory/device reservations, dynamic ports, CSI volumes, host volumes.
- **Rolling deployment controls:** canaries, health checks, auto-promote/auto-revert, max parallel, healthy deadline/progress deadline.
- **Resilience controls:** restart policies for tasks, reschedule policies for allocations, disconnect behavior for client loss, migration on node drain.
- **Batch/on-demand:** parameterized jobs and Nomad Autoscaler support on-demand client capacity for batch workloads.
- **Web UI / API / CLI:** job status, allocation logs/exec, deployment status, variables, nodes, namespaces, evaluations, event stream.

### Nomad Pack

Nomad Pack is Nomad's Helm-like packaging layer.

| Surface    | Feature                                                                                                  | Competitive note                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pack       | Directory with metadata, templates, variables, README, optional outputs/dependencies.                    | Reusable deployment unit for Nomad jobspecs.                    |
| Templates  | HCL jobspec templates rendered with variables and helper functions.                                      | Simple and familiar to operators; not typed app APIs.           |
| Variables  | `--var` and `--var-file`; later files win on duplicate keys.                                             | Comparable to Helm values.                                      |
| Registries | Default community registry plus custom git-based registries via go-getter.                               | Distribution surface for reusable workloads.                    |
| Commands   | `list`, `info`, `render`, `plan`, `run`, `status`, `stop`, `destroy`, `registry add/list/update/delete`. | Covers discover → inspect → render → deploy → remove lifecycle. |
| Caching    | Local `.nomad/packs` cache of registries/packs/refs.                                                     | Useful offline/repeatability detail; refs can pin versions.     |
| CI         | Official setup action exists for GitHub Actions.                                                         | Makes packs automation-friendly.                                |

Example workflow:

```bash
nomad-pack registry add community github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack-community-registry
nomad-pack list
nomad-pack info prometheus
nomad-pack render prometheus -f values.hcl
nomad-pack run prometheus -f values.hcl
nomad-pack status prometheus
nomad-pack destroy prometheus
```

## Differentiators

### Headline differentiators

1. **One scheduler for heterogeneous workloads** — containers, binaries, Java, QEMU, services, batch, system jobs, and parameterized dispatch.
2. **Operational simplicity vs Kubernetes** — small binary/agent model, HCL jobspecs, direct scheduler API, no Kubernetes resource sprawl.
3. **Mature placement/lifecycle controls** — constraints, affinities, spreads, canaries, health-gated deploys, reschedule/restart/migrate behavior, node drains.
4. **HashiCorp-stack integration** — Consul for discovery/mesh, Vault for secrets, Terraform/Packer ecosystem familiarity, HCL language, Sentinel policy in enterprise.
5. **Native workload identity direction** — task/service identities issue JWTs and drive Vault/Consul auth flows.
6. **Nomad Pack distribution** — reusable jobspec packaging with registries and render/plan/run workflow.
7. **Legacy + edge fit** — non-container workloads and simpler operational footprint are compelling for brownfield environments.

### How Nomad positions vs others

- **vs Kubernetes:** simpler scheduler and operations model; supports non-container workloads directly; fewer built-in platform APIs/ecosystem resources.
- **vs PaaS/serverless:** far more control over placement/runtime; much less app-level abstraction, auto-provisioned managed resources, or end-user developer sugar.
- **vs Helm:** Nomad Pack is similar in packaging spirit but targets Nomad jobspecs, not Kubernetes objects.
- **vs Nitric/Encore:** Nomad does not infer cloud resources from application code or generate least-privilege cloud IAM from SDK calls; it schedules declared workloads.
- **vs HoBo:** Nomad is a workload fabric; HoBo is designed as an AI-native meta-cloud with portable app/resource ports, event-sourced runtime semantics, resource matching, and agents as operators/principals.

## Gaps / limitations (opportunities for HoBo)

- **No Infrastructure-from-Code app SDK.** Nomad jobspecs are explicit HCL/JSON; resources are not collected from code like Nitric/HoBo.
- **No built-in cloud managed-resource abstraction.** Databases, buckets, queues, topics, AI, feature flags, etc. require separate products, templates, Terraform, or app-specific wiring.
- **No automatic least-privilege cloud IAM from app operations.** ACLs and workload identity are strong inside Nomad/HashiCorp integrations, but not equivalent to `.allow()` across cloud resources.
- **HashiCorp-stack gravity.** Best experience often assumes Consul, Vault, Terraform, Sentinel, and HCL fluency.
- **Packaging is templating, not typed contracts.** Nomad Pack lacks HoBo-style protobuf/CUE/PACT/WIT conformance gates or generated providers.
- **No event-sourced app runtime.** Nomad manages workload lifecycle, not application state as durable actors, sagas, reactive projections, replayable workflows, or materialized views.
- **No AI-native operator model.** It has APIs/CLI/UI, but no first-class autonomous SRE/GitOps/platform agents with scoped identities, policy gates, and replayable decisions.
- **No WASM Component Model contract.** Wasm can be run if packaged behind a driver/container, but Nomad does not make WIT interfaces the provider contract.
- **Multi-cloud means schedule-anywhere, not provider-portable app resources.** A Nomad job can run in many environments; its backing services are still environment-specific unless external tooling standardizes them.

## HoBo mapping

> For every Nomad/Nomad Pack feature, the HoBo equivalent and the design doc that owns it. ✅ = designed at parity · ➕ = HoBo goes further · ↔ = adjacent/composable · 🔜 = planned/iteration hook. HoBo design lives in [`../design/`](../design/index.md). The displacement decision — why self-hosted wasmCloud ([ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)) + Matching ([ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)) + Dispatcher ([ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)) subsume the scheduler pillar, and Nomad's accepted-future deploy-target disposition — is recorded in [ADR-0106](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0106). Rows with no committed design text anchor to an explicit iteration hook, never to a bare status.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure-from-Code authoring**: resources declared in app code and collected into Manifest IR, not hand-written jobspec-only deployment.                               | [02](../design/sdk-api.md#plan-02), [21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)               |

| **WASM/WASI/WIT-first runtime contract**: providers export WIT interfaces; the membrane is wRPC/component links, not scheduler driver plugins plus ad hoc app protocols.       | [20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20), [ADR-0069](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069) |

### Where Nomad is ahead / pressure on HoBo

- **Battle-tested general scheduler.** Nomad's placement, allocation lifecycle, node drain, canary/update, and mixed-workload support are deep and production-proven.
- **Legacy workload reach.** Raw binaries, Java, QEMU, and driver plugins give Nomad a broad brownfield path HoBo must intentionally preserve through OCI/VM/host adapters.
- **Operational simplicity.** HoBo's broader meta-cloud model risks more moving parts; Nomad's small-binary scheduler story is a high bar for self-hosted operations.
- **Consul/Vault integration depth.** HoBo can target those as providers, but Nomad's native integration is a strong default for HashiCorp shops.
- **Nomad Pack ecosystem.** HoBo's Registry must be as easy as `nomad-pack run`, while adding stronger typing/proofs without making simple deployments feel heavy.
