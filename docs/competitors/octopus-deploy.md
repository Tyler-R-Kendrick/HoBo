# Octopus Deploy — Competitor Reference

> Captured for HoBo competitive analysis under the HoBo Competitive Research Contract.
> Research date **2026-08-20**; first captured August 2026 and restructured to the contract without
> discarding the original mapping work. Factual API/config surface quoted under fair use.
> Read alongside [Argo CD](argo-cd.md) and [Flux CD](flux-cd.md), which occupy the same category
> from the reconciliation end rather than the release-orchestration end.

## What it is

Octopus Deploy is **release orchestration and deployment automation as its own product**, downstream
of CI. Its own positioning is "best-in-class continuous delivery".

- **Product boundary.** It takes packages produced elsewhere and moves them through environments
  under governance. It does not build, and it does not own infrastructure.
- **Operating model.** Commercial, self-hosted server or cloud, with strong enterprise and
  regulated-industry adoption.
- **The differentiator is the domain model.** Octopus models the *delivery* domain explicitly —
  projects, releases, environments, lifecycles, channels, tenants, runbooks — rather than treating
  deploys as CI pipeline scripts. That decision is the entire product and the reason this capture
  exists.

## Core primitives and mental model

| Primitive | What it is |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **Project** | The unit of delivery, owning a deployment process and variables |
| **Release** | An immutable pinning of package versions *plus a snapshot of the deployment process* |
| **Environment** | A named stage (dev, test, prod) that releases are deployed *to* |
| **Lifecycle** | The ordered phases a release passes through, with automatic or manual promotion rules |
| **Channel** | A parallel release stream with its own version rules (e.g. hotfix vs. mainline) |
| **Tenant** | A customer, region or store — the same project deployed many times with scoped variables |
| **Runbook** | An operational procedure modelled beside deployments, runnable on demand or scheduled |
| **Deployment target / worker** | Where steps run: Tentacle agent, SSH, Kubernetes; workers execute steps |
| **Variable set** | Values scoped by environment, tenant, target or channel, including sensitive ones |

The mental model is **a release is a thing, and moving it is a governed event**. That the process
itself is snapshotted into the release is the subtle and correct part: re-deploying an old release
re-runs the process it was built with, not today's.

## Feature surface

### Delivery model
- **Project → Release → Deployment**: a release pins package versions + process snapshot;
  deployments push a release through **Environments** (dev → test → prod) governed by a **Lifecycle**
  with phases and automatic or manual promotion rules; **Channels** allow parallel release streams
  with version rules.
- **Deployment process**: ordered steps (script, package deploy, K8s, Helm, Terraform,
  IIS/Azure/AWS built-ins) with conditions, rolling windows, and guided failure mode.
- **Manual interventions & approvals**: explicit pause-for-human steps with responsible teams
  recorded in the audit trail; ITSM integrations (ServiceNow/Jira) gate on change tickets.
- **Multi-tenancy**: **Tenants** (customers/regions/stores) deploy the same project many times with
  tenant-scoped variables and tenant tags — the canonical "deploy per customer" machinery.
- **Runbooks**: operational procedures (restart, backup, cert rotation) modeled beside deployments —
  same steps/variables/targets/audit, runnable on demand or scheduled, independent of a release.
- **Variables**: scoped variable sets (environment/tenant/target/channel), sensitive variables,
  library variable sets shared across projects.
- **Targets & workers**: agent (Tentacle) or agentless (SSH/K8s) deployment targets grouped by role;
  worker pools for step execution.

### Ops & governance
- Full audit trail of every deployment/intervention; RBAC with teams/roles; spaces for org
  partitioning; Config-as-Code (OCL in Git) for processes.

## Architecture

- **Control plane** — an Octopus Server (or Cloud instance) backed by a relational database holding
  projects, releases, variables and the audit trail. This is a stateful, centrally-authoritative
  design, unlike the in-cluster controllers elsewhere in this category.
- **Execution** — steps run on workers or on targets. **Tentacle** agents support both polling
  (outbound-only, target dials the server) and listening modes; the polling mode is the same
  connectivity lesson this corpus keeps recording.
- **Config-as-Code** — the deployment process can live in the customer's Git repository as OCL,
  which puts the definition where the code is while the server remains the runtime authority.
- **State authority** — the Octopus database. Git holds process definitions when config-as-code is
  used; releases, deployments and audit are the server's.
- **Portability boundary** — the process model is Octopus's own. Steps invoke portable tools
  (Terraform, Helm, kubectl), but lifecycles, channels, tenants and variable scoping do not exist
  outside the product. Leaving means rewriting the delivery model, not just the scripts.

## How it competes with HoBo

| Contested HoBo surface | The contest |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `delivery` | **The direct overlap.** Promotion through environments under gates is what both products do |
| `environments` | Octopus's environment/lifecycle/channel triple is more expressive than HoBo's Camp environment types |
| `governance` | Manual interventions, ITSM gating and a complete audit trail against `@hobo/policy` and event-sourced records |

Octopus does not contest HoBo's application model, provider matching or portability surfaces at all —
it assumes the infrastructure already exists. The contest is narrow and the lesson is wide.

## Primitive mapping

> Legend: ✅ parity · ➕ HoBo goes further · ◐ HoBo thinner · 🔜 planned.
> HoBo's delivery surface is design-phase; Octopus ships today — maturity credit is Octopus's.

| Octopus concept | HoBo equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Release (pinned versions + process snapshot) | **Deployment Set** (immutable) + Deltas | ✅ same immutability bet ([Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25)) |
| Environment + Lifecycle phases | Camps with environment types; promote via `can-deploy`/Gatekeeper | ✅➕ promotion is a policy-gated event, replayable |
| Channels | 🔜 no direct analog; nearest is per-env matching criteria | ◐ |
| Manual intervention / ITSM gate | `require-approval` policy effect + A2H handoff (ADR-0094) | ✅➕ approvals are policy, not process steps |
| Tenants + tenant variables | App-tenant model (Plan 50), per-tenant config/quotas; tenant-scoped deploys | ✅ different substrate (streams, not variable scoping) |
| **Runbooks** | `hobo runbook` verb + StackStorm-informed operator automation ([technologies/stackstorm](../technologies/stackstorm.md), [operators-sre](../design/operators-sre.md#plan-40)) | ◐ HoBo's runbooks are Crew/agent-first; Octopus's human-first maturity is ahead |
| Guided failure / rolling windows | Progressive rollout engine (Harness/OpenDelivery) + Trails compensation | ✅➕ auto-abort on dual-oracle failure |
| Audit trail | Event-sourced journal — audit *is* the source of truth | ➕ replay/time-travel |
| Config-as-Code (OCL) | Bindle TypeScript IR + policy packs in Git | ✅ |
| Tentacle polling mode | Outbound-only agent connectivity | ✅ same conclusion, reached independently |
| — | `match.Decided` / `PortabilityReport` | **No equivalent.** Targets are registered, not chosen. |

## Where Octopus Deploy is stronger

- **The delivery domain model** — environments, lifecycles, channels, tenants as first-class nouns —
  is the clearest articulation in the industry; promotion rules and per-tenant fan-out need no
  scripting.
- **Runbooks beside deployments** unify "deploy" and "operate" into one audit surface, which almost
  nothing else in this corpus does.
- **Manual intervention and ITSM gating** fit regulated change management as shipped, with the
  responsible team recorded in the audit trail rather than in a chat thread.
- **Per-tenant delivery is solved**, not approximated. Deploying one project to hundreds of
  customer-specific instances with scoped variables is the mature answer to a problem HoBo currently
  describes rather than implements.
- **Process snapshotting.** Re-deploying an old release re-runs its original process — a correctness
  property most pipeline tools do not have.
- **Years of production scars** in exactly the regulated organizations HoBo's residency and policy
  work targets.

## Where HoBo is stronger or intentionally different

State labels follow the research contract.

- **An application model** (*implemented*). Octopus orchestrates *packages onto targets*; the
  application's resources come from elsewhere, at best a Terraform step.
- **Provider negotiation** (*implemented*, `match.Decided`). Octopus environments point at
  pre-existing infrastructure: no matching, no cost-aware placement, no IaC ownership.
- **Portability is measured** (*implemented*, ADR-0144); Octopus has no such notion.
- **Residency is fail-closed** (*implemented*, ADR-0146) rather than a variable scoped by region.
- **Audit is the source of truth** (*implemented*, ADR-0135) — an event-sourced journal that replays,
  against Octopus's audit log, which records what happened but does not reconstitute state.
- **Agent-addressable surface** (*proof*). Octopus's agent/AI surface is thin.
- **Honest caveat.** On the surface where they overlap — modelling delivery — Octopus is ahead, and
  HoBo's design borrows from it rather than improving on it.

## Adversarial critique

- **It is downstream of everything.** Octopus assumes someone else built the artifact and someone
  else provisioned the infrastructure. That focus is why the model is clean, and it is also why the
  product cannot answer "where should this run".
- **The domain model is also lock-in.** Lifecycles, channels, tenants and scoped variables have no
  portable representation. Config-as-Code puts *steps* in Git; it does not make the delivery model
  portable.
- **Variable scoping is powerful and famously hard to reason about.** Environment × tenant × target ×
  channel scoping resolves by precedence rules that teams get wrong, and debugging a wrong value is a
  common support theme.
- **Commercial cost scales with targets**, which pushes teams toward fewer, larger targets — an
  incentive that works against the fine-grained deployment topology the product otherwise enables.
- **The server is a stateful single point of authority** with a database to back up, upgrade and
  scale — the opposite trade from the in-cluster controllers in this category, with the operational
  burden that implies.
- **Kubernetes support is a step type, not a philosophy.** Against Argo CD and Flux it is a
  competent integration rather than a native model, and Kubernetes-first organizations notice.
- **Runbooks can become shadow infrastructure.** An operational procedure that is easier to run than
  to codify properly tends to stay a runbook forever, which is a governance risk dressed as a
  feature.

## Better-together / integration posture

- **Borrow** — the primary posture, and the reason this capture is P2 rather than P3:
  1. **The delivery domain as first-class nouns.** HoBo's Deployment Sets, environment types and
     promotion gates credit this lineage (jointly with Humanitec).
  2. **Runbooks beside deployments**, one audit surface for deploy *and* operate — the exact shape of
     HoBo's runbook verb plus Crew operations.
  3. **Process snapshotting into the release**, which HoBo gets for free from immutable Deployment
     Sets and should state as a deliberate property rather than an implementation detail.
  4. **Tenant-scoped fan-out** as the reference design for HoBo's app-tenant model.
- **Benchmark** on approval workflows and regulated change management, where Octopus is the bar.
- Not a provider target, render target or displace target: HoBo and Octopus want to own the same
  moment in the lifecycle, from opposite ends, and the realistic outcome in an Octopus shop is that
  HoBo does not arrive.

## Threats and lessons

1. **The delivery domain deserves its own model.** Octopus proves it commercially. HoBo absorbs that
   model into an event-sourced, policy-gated, provider-negotiated control plane instead of a
   downstream orchestrator — but it must absorb it *fully*, and channels are a real gap.
2. **Approvals belong in the model, not in the pipeline.** Recording who approved what, against which
   release, in the same store as the deployment itself is why regulated buyers choose this product.
   HoBo's `require-approval` policy effect is the right shape and is not yet as complete.
3. **Per-tenant delivery is a first-class requirement, not an advanced case.** Octopus built tenants
   because customers deploy the same thing hundreds of times. HoBo's tenancy story should be designed
   for that number, not for two.
4. **Incumbency in regulated delivery is very hard to displace.** The audit trail *is* the compliance
   evidence, and replacing it means re-establishing years of it. Where Octopus is installed, HoBo's
   realistic story is the layer above it, not instead of it — and this capture does not pretend
   otherwise.
