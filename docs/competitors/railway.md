# Railway — competitor reference

> A faithful, detailed capture of **Railway** (railway.com / railway.app) for HoBo competitive analysis. Railway is the **shipping-DX benchmark**: a polished, single-vendor **PaaS on its own hardware** where a `git push` (or a one-click template) becomes a live service on a **visual canvas** in seconds. It is the opposite pole from HoBo on strategy — Railway **owns the metal** and is deliberately single-vendor; HoBo is a **multi-cloud, self-hostable control plane** — which makes it the sharpest reference for *DX polish, template ecosystem, and price/perf-by-vertical-integration*, none of which HoBo (design-phase, meta-cloud, no-billing) sets out to match head-on.

## What it is

Railway is a **fully managed, single-vendor PaaS** that brands itself *"the all-in-one intelligent cloud provider."* You bring source code (a GitHub repo, a Docker image, or a local directory) or a **template**, and Railway builds it, runs it as a **service**, networks it on a private IPv6 mesh, gives it a domain with automatic TLS, and shows the whole system on an editable **canvas** — a real-time project graph of services, databases, and their connections. Managed databases (**Postgres, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, ClickHouse**), persistent **volumes**, cron, functions, and **ephemeral PR environments** are all first-class. Every `git push` to a linked branch triggers an automatic build-and-deploy.

The mental model is **PaaS click-ops + config-as-code**, *not* infrastructure-from-code. You compose the system on the canvas (or via CLI), and pin per-service build/deploy settings in a `railway.json` / `railway.toml` file that lives next to your code and **overrides the dashboard**. There is no "declare a `bucket()` in your app code and the platform provisions it" IfC step (as in Encore/Nitric/HoBo) — Railway is a **hosting platform you wire**, whose defining virtue is that the wiring is *instant, visual, and zero-config*. Its build system (**Railpack**, successor to Nixpacks) auto-detects language/framework so most repos deploy with no Dockerfile.

The strategic bet that sets Railway apart is **Railway Metal**: Railway migrated 100% of workloads off third-party clouds onto **its own bare-metal servers in its own datacenters** ("you can't build a cloud on another cloud. We were losing $20 for every dollar that came in"). Owning the hardware is what funds cheaper egress/storage, faster NVMe, HA volumes, static IPs, and an anycast edge — a **vertical-integration price/perf play** a control-plane like HoBo structurally does not make. The second bet is **agent-native**: a dashboard **Railway Agent**, a local + hosted **MCP server**, an open **agent-skills** format, and **sandboxes** with Claude Code/Codex/OpenCode baked in — Railway is positioning agents as first-class operators of the platform.

## Feature surface

### Services, deployments & the build system

A **service** is Railway's unit of deploy. It sources from one of three places: a **GitHub repository** ("when a new commit is pushed to the linked branch, Railway will automatically build and deploy the new code"), a **Docker image** (public registries — Docker Hub, GHCR, Quay, GitLab, MCR — or private registries on Pro, with automatic update monitoring), or a **local directory** pushed with `railway up`. If a `Dockerfile` is present Railway uses it; otherwise the **Railpack** builder (successor to Nixpacks) auto-detects the language/framework and builds an image with no config. Services carry variables, source references, and start/build commands; horizontal scaling is by **replicas** (up to 6 on Hobby, 42 on Pro, 50 on Enterprise per service), with **multi-region** replica placement.

### The Canvas — the project graph

Railway's signature surface is the **Canvas**: the default project view is *"a visual graph displaying all services in a project and their dependencies… services, databases, and connections mapped out in an intuitive graph."* It is **real-time multiplayer** — "multiple team members can view logs, deployment state, and service topology in the Railway canvas simultaneously, with updates reflected without requiring a page reload." Staged changes (from duplicating or syncing an environment) surface on the canvas tagged **"New" / "Edited" / "Removed"** before you apply them. This editable topology graph — not a YAML file — is the primary authoring interface, and it is the single most-cited reason developers choose Railway.

### Config-as-code — `railway.json` / `railway.toml`

Per-service **build** and **deploy** settings can live in a file next to the code; *"configuration defined in code will always override values from the dashboard."* Railway looks for `railway.toml` or `railway.json` (custom absolute path set in service settings, e.g. `/backend/railway.toml`). A JSON schema at `railway.com/railway.schema.json` gives editor autocomplete. Verbatim from the reference:

```toml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "railpack"
buildCommand = "echo building!"

[deploy]
preDeployCommand = ["npm run db:migrate"]
startCommand = "echo starting!"
healthcheckPath = "/"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "never"
```

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
    "build": { "builder": "RAILPACK", "buildCommand": "echo building!" },
    "deploy": {
      "preDeployCommand": ["npm run db:migrate"],
      "startCommand": "echo starting!",
      "healthcheckPath": "/",
      "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
      "restartPolicyType": "never"
    }
}
```

Documented keys — **build:** `builder` (`RAILPACK` default · `DOCKERFILE`), `buildCommand`, `watchPatterns`, `dockerfilePath`, `railpackVersion`; **deploy:** `startCommand`, `preDeployCommand`, `healthcheckPath`, `healthcheckTimeout`, `restartPolicyType` (`ON_FAILURE`/`ALWAYS`/`NEVER`), `restartPolicyMaxRetries`, `cronSchedule`, `numReplicas`/`multiRegionConfig`, `overlapSeconds`, `drainingSeconds`; plus an `environments.[name]` block (with a special `pr` key) for per-environment overrides. Note the scope: this configures **one service's build/deploy**, not the cross-service resource graph — that is drawn on the canvas or scripted with the CLI. (Railway also documents a separate **Infrastructure-as-Code** path for defining whole projects programmatically.)

### Databases — the (ex-"plugins") template model

Railway offers one-click **Postgres** (plus **Postgres HA** with automatic failover and a **PgBouncer connection-pooling** variant), **MySQL**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, and **ClickHouse**, deployed from *"templates maintained by Railway [that] come pre-configured with sensible defaults."* Crucially, Railway states these *"database templates are **unmanaged services**"* where *"users handle backups, performance tuning, security, and monitoring themselves"* — they are containers running on your volumes, not a managed DBaaS with an SLA (backups/PITR, TCP-proxy external access, and private networking are provided; day-2 operation is yours). Any other database ships as a Docker image or a community/marketplace template. (Historically Railway called these "plugins"; the current model is database **services** from templates.)

### Templates & the marketplace (with creator monetization)

Templates *"package a service or set of services into a reusable, distributable format"*; users deploy them from the **marketplace** at `railway.com/templates`, save/replicate project configs, and get update notifications. For creators, Railway runs a **Kickback / partner program**: maintainers *"earn commission from template usage, up to 25% as part of the partner program,"* and can distribute **private Docker images** to *"monetize premium versions or hosted-only editions,"* with a Template Queue, deployment metrics, and an earnings dashboard. This template **network effect + marketplace monetization** is a real, shipping moat — and, notably, one HoBo does **not** try to replicate (monetization is out of HoBo's design scope, [ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)).

### Environments & PR environments

Every project gets a `production` environment; you add more by **Duplicate** (*"a copy… including services, variables, and configuration"*, staged for review) or **Empty**. **PR Environments** are ephemeral: *"created when a Pull Request is opened… deleted as soon as the PR is merged or closed,"* with automatic domain provisioning, **Focused PR Environments** (deploy only the services whose code changed, per watch paths), and **Bot PR Environments**. Config is env-scoped (*"all changes made to a service are scoped to a single environment"*); services reference each other via `${{service.URL}}` / `${{service.VAR}}`; **Sync Environments** imports services between environments (replacing the older fork flow).

### Volumes & storage

**Volumes** give a service persistent storage at an absolute **mount path** (auto-exposed as `RAILWAY_VOLUME_NAME` / `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH`); data *"survives deployments and restarts."* **Live resize** ("without any downtime") is available on all paid plans; a volume at 100% capacity triggers a brief offline resize. Manual + automated **backups** are supported. On Metal, Railway offers **High-Availability Volumes**. Volumes are runtime-only (not mounted at build or pre-deploy time).

### Private networking

Services on a project/environment share a private mesh: *"services communicate over encrypted Wireguard tunnels using internal DNS,"* discovered automatically at `SERVICE_NAME.railway.internal` (e.g. `http://api.railway.internal:PORT`) over **IPv6**, with *"no port exposure or configuration required."* Public traffic gets automatic TLS; **TCP Proxy** exposes databases externally. Metal adds **static inbound IPs** and an **anycast edge network**.

### Railway Metal — their own hardware

Railway Metal is *"the next generation of Railway's underlying infrastructure… hardware that Railway owns and operates in datacenters around the world,"* replacing third-party clouds. Live regions: **US West · US East · EU West (Amsterdam) · SE Asia (Singapore)**. Migrating workloads onto Metal cut **egress 50% ($0.10→$0.05/GB)** and **storage 40% ($0.25→$0.15/GB)**, removed per-seat charges on Pro, and unlocked *"Static Inbound IPs, Anycast Edge Network, High-Availability Volumes."* **Gen 2** hardware: *"AMD Zen 5c EPYC CPUs with 96 cores (192 threads), DDR5, 5× more storage than Gen 1, dual 100G ConnectX-6 NICs"* — *"5× more compute capacity"* and *"5× more network throughput"*; 750TB raw storage per rack; a 12.8Tbps Tomahawk-3 fabric; dark-fiber interconnects. The rationale is unit economics + performance control: *"you can't build a cloud on another cloud."* This is the axis where Railway is **genuinely, structurally ahead of a meta-cloud** — it captures the full margin and latency of owning the silicon.

### The `railway` CLI

Install `brew install railway` or `npm i -g @railway/cli`. Documented commands (verbatim groups):

```bash
# auth / project
railway login | logout | whoami
railway init | link | unlink | list | status | open
# deploy
railway up | deploy | redeploy | restart | down | deployment list
# services / scale
railway add | service | scale | delete
# vars / envs
railway variable list | variable set | environment
# local dev
railway run | shell | dev
# logs / debug
railway logs | ssh | connect | metrics
# networking
railway domain | cdn | waf | tcp-proxy
# volumes / buckets
railway volume list | bucket list
# functions / sandboxes / agents
railway functions list | sandbox create | agent | setup agent
```

`railway run` injects the service's variables into a local process; `railway ssh` / `railway connect` open a shell / a database session against the deployed service. The presence of `agent`, `sandbox`, `functions`, `cdn`, `waf`, and `bucket` commands shows how far Railway's surface has grown past classic PaaS.

### AI & agents

Railway is aggressively **agent-native**. The **Railway Agent** is a dashboard chat assistant that can *"manage services, diagnose failing deployments, and open pull requests to fix issues in your code"* — and can spin up its own sandboxes to do real debugging, not just describe fixes. The **MCP server** runs **local** (via CLI) or **hosted remote** at `mcp.railway.com`, exposing *"project and service discovery, deployment status, bounded logs, variables, domains, templates, metrics, and scoped mutations"* plus a *"powerful `railway-agent` tool for multi-step operations."* An **open agent-skills** format (`use-railway`, distributed via a Claude Code plugin marketplace with hooks/scripts) teaches agents *"how to operate Railway… instead of guessing,"* working across **Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, Factory Droid, Windsurf, Cline, and Devin**. **Sandboxes** ship Claude Code/Codex/OpenCode/Pi in the default image and *"join the same network and talk to the services alongside it,"* so agents test against real Postgres/Redis/internal services. This is shipping today — a live benchmark for HoBo's own agent-native posture.

### Pricing (usage-based)

Plans are a **minimum spend + metered usage**. **Trial** (one-time $5 grant) · **Hobby $5/mo** (includes $5 of usage; overage billed per-second) · **Pro $20/mo/seat** (includes $20 of usage; team collaboration, private registries, higher limits) · **Enterprise** (custom; compliance, SLAs, TAM). Per-resource rates: **RAM $10/GB/mo · vCPU $20/mo · volume storage $0.15/GB/mo · egress $0.05/GB**. Limits scale by plan (Hobby up to 6 replicas / 48 vCPU / 48 GB per service; Pro up to 42 replicas / 1,000 vCPU / 1 TB; Enterprise up to 50 replicas / 2.4 TB). Post-Metal, **Pro dropped per-seat resource charges**. Usage-based billing is core to Railway's model — and **out of scope for HoBo by design** ([ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)).

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what Railway does genuinely well — and ships)

- **Best-in-class zero-config DX.** `git push` → built (Railpack auto-detects the stack, no Dockerfile) → live with TLS in seconds; one-click databases; instant rollbacks. This is the **shipping bar** for "it just deploys" — and HoBo, in design phase, does not yet match the polish.
- **The Canvas.** A real-time, multiplayer, editable **project graph** is a delightful, differentiated authoring surface that most competitors (and HoBo's design) approach only as read-mostly topology views.
- **Template marketplace + creator monetization.** A large one-click ecosystem with a **Kickback partner program (up to 25%)** and private-image monetization — a real network effect HoBo deliberately won't reproduce.
- **Owns its metal.** **Railway Metal** (own DCs, AMD Zen 5c, NVMe, 100G, anycast edge) funds cheaper egress/storage, HA volumes, static IPs, and faster performance — a **vertical-integration price/perf advantage** a control plane cannot structurally match on any one provider.
- **Aggressively agent-native, today.** Railway Agent, local+remote MCP, open agent skills, and sandboxes with coding agents baked in — across nine+ AI tools. A live, shipping instance of the agent-native cloud thesis.
- **Coherent, complete PaaS.** PR environments, private Wireguard/IPv6 networking, volumes with live-resize, config-as-code, TCP proxy, cron, functions — a full, well-integrated product.

### Gaps (Railway's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **Single-vendor by construction; everything runs on Railway.** No multi-cloud, **no "deploy into your own AWS/GCP/Azure," no bring-your-own-cloud, no self-host, no on-prem.** Your app, data, wiring, and canvas are Railway-specific; Metal *is* the platform. HoBo is the inverse: a **cloud-agnostic control plane** that maps one app onto any mix of providers **and self-host** (Yard-is-a-Bindle), with **pluggable IaC** (Pulumi/Crossplane/TF/OpenTofu) under the hood ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04) / [ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)).
- **Not infrastructure-from-code.** Railway is **config-as-code + click-ops** — you wire services on the canvas / in the dashboard, and `railway.json` configures *one service's* build/deploy. There is no "declare a resource inline in app code and the platform provisions + wires + least-privileges it." HoBo's authoring model is **IfC** — resources declared inline, collected to a manifest IR, with `.allow()` driving one-decl-three-effects (IAM + capability link + token) ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)).
- **Container-only runtime.** OCI/Docker is the only unit; language portability comes from Docker, not a capability-secured polyglot runtime. HoBo defaults to **wasm/WIT components** — any wasm-compiling language, deny-by-default capability security ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20) / [ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)).
- **Databases are unmanaged.** PG/MySQL/Redis/Mongo/ClickHouse run as **unmanaged container templates** — you own backups, tuning, security, HA. There is no typed data-paradigm abstraction and no mapping to cloud-native managed engines. HoBo exposes **typed catalog ports** (`sql`/`kv`/`cache`/`bucket`/`vector`) and **paradigm packages** (`@hobo/sql`/`vector`/`graph`/`document`, [ADR-0052/0081](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0081)) that map to managed cloud natives by default and stay overridable.
- **No platform-rules layer.** Environments are duplicates/syncs of services **all pinned to Railway's own infra** — no "same app, cheap preview vs managed-HA prod, per environment, auditably." HoBo adds **Resource Definitions + Matching** (`match.Decided`) + a cost-aware **Dispatcher** ([Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25) / [ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033) / [ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)).
- **No event-sourced control plane / audit-replay, and no governance planes.** No contracts / `can-deploy` / policy / flags plane, no replayable platform history, no RBAC over the platform's own decisions beyond dashboard roles. HoBo ships an event-sourced runtime ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11)) + governance (Contract/Eval/Policy/Trace) + contracts/policy/flags ([Plan 29](../design/contracts-policy-flags.md#plan-29)) + org/RBAC/SSO/SCIM ([ADR-0074](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0074)).
- **No multi-tenant-app primitives.** A SaaS builder gets no app-tenant model, isolation spectrum, per-tenant routing/quota/residency. HoBo ships this ([Plan 50](../design/security-networking.md#plan-50) / [ADR-0079](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0079) / [ADR-0080](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0080)).
- **No adopt-in-place onboarding / cross-cloud data.** No "import my existing TF/Pulumi estate"; leaving means rebuilding the wiring elsewhere (the Docker images are portable, the canvas/config is not). HoBo specifies `hobo import` ([ADR-0041](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0041)) + app-data migration ([ADR-0032](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0032)).
- **Agent story is operate-not-generate.** Railway Agent introspects, diagnoses, and edits *your* app; it does not **generate cloud providers/adapters**, carry a first-class agent identity, or self-optimize semantic functions. HoBo's generation pipeline generates adapters ([Plan 23](../design/generated-stack.md#plan-23)), agents are principals with brokered tokens ([Plan 6](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)), and `"use training"` methods self-optimize.

> **Not gaps — different by design.** Railway's **usage-based billing** and **template-marketplace monetization (Kickback up to 25%)** are core, healthy parts of *its* commercial model, but they are **out of HoBo's scope on purpose** ([ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)): HoBo is OSS with metering/showback FinOps and **no billing** ([Plan 5](../design/reliability-observability-cost.md#plan-05) / [ADR-0039](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0039)), and its registry distributes **Resource Packs without a paid marketplace** ([ADR-0062](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0062)). Likewise, **owning the metal** is a strength HoBo does not contest — HoBo federates *any* provider (including your own hardware) rather than operating a single fleet.

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** Railway is a **single-vendor, container-centric PaaS on its own metal**, authored by canvas + config-as-code, **shipping and polished**, usage-billed, and aggressively agent-native. HoBo is a **multi-cloud + self-hostable control plane**, authored by **IfC**, running a **wasm/WIT** runtime, **event-sourced + governed**, OSS with no billing — and **design-phase**. Railway sets the bar for *DX polish, template ecosystem, and own-metal price/perf*; HoBo's edge is *breadth (any cloud + self-host), the runtime, the governance/matching planes, data-paradigm breadth, and generation-grade AI-native depth*.
- **vs Render / Fly / Heroku:** Railway is the **canvas-first, agent-native, own-metal** challenger — more visual, and cheaper on egress/storage post-Metal.
- **vs Vercel:** Vercel is frontend/edge-first; Railway is **backend/full-stack** — long-running containers, databases, volumes, cron on its own hardware.
- **vs Encore / Nitric:** those are **IfC frameworks** — declare resources in code, provision *your* cloud. Railway is a **hosted PaaS on its own infra** with config-as-code, not IfC, and it *owns* the metal rather than deploying into your account. HoBo takes IfC + multi-cloud from Encore/Nitric and adds the runtime/governance Railway lacks.
- **vs Convex / Lakebed:** all three are single-vendor managed backends; Railway is the most **infrastructure-shaped** (containers, DBs, volumes, networking) rather than a reactive-DB/full-stack-app runtime.

**Net:** Railway is the **polished, shipping, agent-native PaaS that owns its own hardware** — the reference for *how good the deploy experience can feel* and *what vertical integration buys in price/perf*. But it is **single-vendor by construction** (everything on Railway Metal), **container + config-centric** (not IfC, not wasm), and **ungoverned** (no event-sourcing / matching / policy planes). HoBo's opening is exactly the axes Railway forecloses — **multi-cloud + self-host + pluggable IaC, an IfC authoring model over a wasm/WIT runtime, Resource Definitions/Matching + the Dispatcher, a broad typed data-paradigm catalog, event-sourced governance, multi-tenant-app primitives, and generation-grade AI-native depth** — while HoBo openly concedes Railway's DX polish, template-marketplace network effect, and own-metal economics as real, shipping advantages it does not set out to match head-on.

### The one-line takeaway

**Railway proves how good a single-vendor deploy experience can feel** — an editable real-time canvas, instant git-push deploys, one-click databases, a monetized template marketplace, and its own bare-metal fleet for price/perf — all **shipping and polished** while HoBo is **design-phase**. HoBo does not contest Railway on DX polish, ecosystem, or owning the metal; its differentiation is the model Railway rejects by construction: **multi-cloud + self-host + pluggable IaC, IfC authoring over a wasm/WIT runtime, Resource Definitions/Matching + the Dispatcher, a broad typed data-paradigm catalog, event-sourced governance, multi-tenant-app primitives, and generation-grade AI-native depth** — a cloud-agnostic, governed control plane rather than one exceptionally good cloud.
