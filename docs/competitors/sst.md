# SST — competitor reference

> A faithful, detailed capture of **SST** for HoBo competitive analysis. SST is a **close product analog** to HoBo: **Infrastructure-from-Code** where you author your whole stack in one `sst.config.ts`, deploy into **your own** cloud account, and **link** resources into typed runtime code. Its v3 **"Ion"** rewrite dropped AWS CDK/CloudFormation for a **Pulumi + Terraform** engine (150+ providers).

## What it is

SST is an **open-source framework** (MIT, by the SST team — formerly "Serverless Stack") positioned as *"Build full-stack apps on your own infrastructure."* You define your **entire app in code** — *"your entire app is defined in code"* — databases, buckets, queues, cron, frontends, containers, functions, even third-party resources (Stripe products) — in a single **`sst.config.ts`**, then deploy it into **your own** AWS/Cloudflare/… account. SST calls this **Infrastructure-from-Code**.

**The v3 "Ion" engine shift matters.** SST v1/v2 were built on **AWS CDK + CloudFormation**; after ~3 years the team hit CloudFormation's design limits and **rewrote the engine** (v3, codenamed "Ion") on **Pulumi + Terraform providers** — using only the **open-source** parts (*"does not require a Pulumi account"*). The new model: **the deployment happens right from your local machine**, state is **stored locally and backed up to S3** (no CloudFormation), CloudFormation's stack/resource limits are gone, and the provider surface jumps to **150+ providers**. SST's own framing: *"The simpler deployment model has also led to far fewer gotchas."* The Ion CLI/engine is written in **Go** (`sst/ion` → now `sst/sst`).

The mental model is closest to **typed IaC-as-a-real-program** (Pulumi-style) with two ergonomic layers on top: **high-level "components"** that collapse dozens of low-level cloud resources into a few lines, and **resource Linking** that injects those resources — with generated types and auto-IAM — into your application runtime via an **`import { Resource } from "sst"`** SDK. Unlike Nitric/HoBo's *run-to-collect* IfC (declare a resource inline where you use it), SST keeps infra in the **config program** and **links** it into app code — more explicit and controllable, less "declare it where you use it."

| Dimension | SST (v3 "Ion") |
|---|---|
| Authoring | **Infrastructure-from-Code** in a typed **`sst.config.ts`** (TypeScript); infra is a program, linked into app runtime |
| Engine | **Pulumi + Terraform providers** (OSS only; no Pulumi account). v1/v2 were **CDK/CloudFormation** — replaced in v3 |
| Components | Built-in high-level `sst.aws.*` / `sst.cloudflare.*` (a Next.js app ≈ *"70 low-level AWS resources"* in a few lines) **+** raw low-level Pulumi/TF resources |
| Resources | Function (Lambda), Service/Task/Cluster (Fargate/ECS), Api/ApiGateway/AppSync/Realtime/Router, Bucket, Postgres/Aurora/Dynamo/Redis, Queue/SnsTopic, Cron, Vpc/Email/Efs, Secret, Auth, + framework sites (Nextjs/Remix/Astro/SvelteKit/SolidStart/Nuxt/StaticSite) |
| Linking | `link: [resource]` → injects links into the function package + **generates types** + **grants IAM permission**; runtime `Resource.X.*`. SDK: **JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust** |
| Permissions | `link` auto-grants; or manual `permissions: [{ actions, resources }]`; `sst.Linkable` to link arbitrary/custom values |
| Clouds | **AWS-centric** (deep `sst.aws.*`); Cloudflare partial; **150+ providers** as raw Pulumi/TF resources (Azure/GCP/Stripe/Vercel/Auth0/PlanetScale/…) |
| Local dev | **`sst dev` "Live"** — deploys **stub** Lambdas, **proxies real cloud invocations to your local machine** (AppSync Events + WebSocket), **<10ms** reload, **real AWS creds/IAM**; VPC via `sst tunnel` |
| State | **local state file (JSON)** + **"Home"** backend (`aws`\|`cloudflare`) → S3 `sst-state-<hash>` + SSM passphrase for secret encryption; latest **30 snapshots** |
| Deploy | `sst deploy --stage <name>` **from your machine** into your account; **stages** = environments (personal stage default) |
| Console | Optional **SaaS** (`console.sst.dev`): logs, zero-instrument **Issues**, resources view, update permalinks, **Autodeploy** (CodeBuild in *your* account) + PR preview envs |
| AI | **None** for infra (no MCP control surface, no agent identity, no generation) — SST's AI work is a separate coding agent (`opencode`), not infra automation |
| License / price | **MIT** OSS core; **Console** free ≤ 350 active resources, then **$0.086/resource** (≤2000) / **$0.032/resource** (>2000); personal/local stages free |

## Feature surface

### Infrastructure-from-Code — the `sst.config.ts` model

Your whole stack lives in one typed file. You instantiate **components** (which resolve to Pulumi/TF resources), wire them with plain code, and use `link` to expose them to your runtime:

```ts
// sst.config.ts
export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return { name: "my-app", home: "aws", providers: { aws: { region: "us-east-1" } } };
  },
  async run() {
    const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
    const web = new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", { link: [bucket] });   // ~70 AWS resources, a few lines
    return { url: web.url };
  },
});
```

- **`app()`** declares the app **name**, the **`home`** (state) provider, and providers/regions. **`run()`** is the infra program (a real function — loops, conditionals, `if (stage === "production")` branching are just code).
- **Stages** are environments: `sst deploy --stage production`; with no stage you get a **personal stage** (stored in `.sst/stage`). This is imperative env-branching, not a declarative platform-rules layer.
- Infra is a **separate program** from your app; the bridge to runtime is **Linking** (below).

### Components — the catalog

SST distinguishes two kinds ([components docs](https://sst.dev/docs/components/)):

- **Built-in components** — high-level abstractions by the SST team, namespaced **`sst.aws.*`** / **`sst.cloudflare.*`**, that *"represent features in your app; like your frontends, APIs, databases, or queues"* and collapse many low-level resources (a Next.js frontend ≈ *"70 low-level AWS resources"*).
- **Provider components** — *"all the Pulumi/Terraform providers are supported"* as raw low-level resources (e.g. `new aws.s3.BucketV2(...)`) for granular control. These are **not** cloud-portable abstractions.

| Category | Built-in `sst.aws.*` components (representative) |
|---|---|
| **Compute / functions** | `Function` (Lambda — Node/Go official, Python/Rust community; `handler`, `runtime`, `memory`, `timeout`, `url`, `vpc`, `link`, `permissions`) |
| **Containers** | `Cluster` (ECS in a VPC) · `Service` (long-running Fargate; autoscaling, ALB/NLB/API-GW/CloudMap, `link`) · `Task` (Fargate one-off/batch) |
| **APIs / edge** | `Api` (API Gateway HTTP) · `ApiGatewayV1`/`V2` · `AppSync` (GraphQL) · `Realtime` (IoT/WebSocket) · `Router` (CloudFront routing to a URL / function / frontend / S3 bucket) |
| **Data** | `Bucket` (S3) · `Postgres` (RDS) · `Aurora` · `Dynamo` · `Redis` · `Efs` |
| **Messaging / jobs** | `Queue` (SQS) · `SnsTopic` · `Cron` |
| **Networking / misc** | `Vpc` · `Email` (SES) · `Secret` · `Auth` (OpenAuth-based) |
| **Frontends** | `Nextjs` · `Remix` · `Astro` · `SvelteKit` · `SolidStart` · `Nuxt` · `StaticSite` (S3+CloudFront) |

Each built-in component maps to **one or more Pulumi/TF resources**; the low-level provider resources remain available underneath as an escape hatch.

### Resource Linking + the SDK (SST's `.allow()` analog)

Linking is SST's headline DX — it connects the infra program to runtime code. You pass resources to a component's **`link`**:

```ts
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", { handler: "src/lambda.handler", link: [bucket] });
```

SST documents three effects of a link: **"The _links_ that the resource exposes are injected into the function package"**, **"The types to access these links are generated"**, and **"The function is given permission to access the linked resource."** At runtime you read them off a typed **`Resource`** object:

```js
import { Resource } from "sst";
console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);   // typed, IDE-autocompleted
```

- **SDK languages:** *"The SDK currently supports JS/TS, Python, Golang, and Rust."* (Config authoring itself is **TypeScript-only**.)
- **Custom/arbitrary links:** `sst.Linkable` / `sst.Linkable.wrap()` link non-SST values (e.g. a third-party credential) into the same typed surface.
- **Manual IAM** (when link isn't enough): a `permissions` array of `{ actions, resources }`:

```ts
permissions: [{ actions: ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"], resources: ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"] }]
```

So linking gives **auto-generated permissions + injected config + generated types** — SST's closest thing to Nitric/HoBo's inline `.allow()`, but declared in the **config program** rather than at the app-code point of use.

### Providers, state & the "Home" backend

- **Providers** — *"supports 150+ providers"* (AWS, Cloudflare, Azure, GCP, Stripe, Vercel, Auth0, PlanetScale, …). Add one with **`sst add <provider>`** (adds to config, installs packages, **registers the namespace globally** — *"Do not `import` the provider packages in your `sst.config.ts`"*). Versions are **pinned** and *"do not auto-update"* (`sst install` to update). Multi-region via multiple `new aws.Provider(...)` instances + `{ provider }`.
- **State** — *"SST creates a state file locally to keep track of the state of the infrastructure in your app"* (a JSON file, Pulumi-style). The **"Home"** is the cloud that stores state — *"aws and cloudflare are supported"* — which auto-adds itself as a provider. On AWS this is an **S3 bucket `sst-state-<hash>`** + an **SSM parameter `/sst/passphrase/<app>/<stage>`** whose passphrase **encrypts secrets** in state. SST **"keeps the latest 30 snapshots"** and prunes older ones with their event logs. **No Pulumi Cloud** dependency.

### Live development — `sst dev`

SST's most distinctive feature. `sst dev` runs the app in dev mode with **Live Lambda**: it deploys **stub** functions to AWS that **proxy real cloud invocations to your local machine**, execute them locally, and proxy the response back.

- Mechanism: *"It works by proxying requests from AWS to your local machine, executing it locally, and proxying the response back."* Transport is **AWS AppSync Events** over a **WebSocket**; local execution runs as a Node.js Worker; **"changes are reloaded in under 10ms"** with no redeploy.
- **High fidelity:** it uses **real AWS credentials**, so **IAM permission failures happen locally** just like prod; it sets **`SST_DEV=true`** for conditional logic; VPC resources are reachable via a tunnel (`sudo sst tunnel install`).
- **Frontends** (Nextjs/Remix/Astro/…) start their **own dev server in a separate tab** and are **not deployed** during `sst dev`.
- **Caveat:** *"Only use `sst dev` in your personal stage"* — the stubs persist if the CLI dies, causing timeouts on later deploys; and there is **no fully-offline mode** (Live needs a real AWS account + deployed stubs).

### Console, Autodeploy & pricing

The **SST Console** (`console.sst.dev`) is an **optional SaaS** dashboard:

- **Logs** (CloudWatch, searchable) · **Issues** — real-time error tracking for Node Lambda/containers with **"Nothing to setup, no code to instrument"**, automatic **source maps**, and Slack/email alerts · **Resources** view (full state + relationships + outputs) · **Updates** (per-deploy permalink + modified-resource list + build logs) · **Local logs** from `sst dev`.
- **Autodeploy** — git-based CI/CD: *"can auto-deploy your apps when you git push to your GitHub repo"* using **AWS CodeBuild in your own account**; branch/PR **preview environments**; configured via `console.autodeploy.*` callbacks in `sst.config.ts`.
- **Pricing** — free for workspaces with **"350 active resources or fewer"**; then **"$0.086 per resource"** for the first 2000 active resources/mo and **"$0.032 per resource"** above 2000. "Active" = a stage that has existed **≥2 weeks** and was updated that month; **personal/local stages are free**. **SaaS-only today**; a self-hostable version is described as *"planned"* but not shipped.

### CLI

```bash
sst init                     # create sst.config.ts in the current project
sst dev                      # Live dev (stub + proxy to local); deploys to personal stage
sst deploy [--stage <name>]  # deploy from your machine into your account
sst diff                     # preview changes before deploy
sst remove                   # tear down the app's resources
sst add <provider>           # add + install + register a provider
sst install                  # install/update pinned providers from config
sst secret set|remove|load|list   # manage encrypted secrets
sst shell                    # run a command with all linked resources in the env
sst state edit|export|list|remove|repair   # manage state
sst refresh                  # reconcile local state with cloud reality
sst unlock                   # release a stuck deploy lock
sst tunnel                   # VPC connectivity for Live dev
sst cert | diagnostic | version | upgrade | telemetry
```

Stages come from `--stage`, `SST_STAGE`, or the personal stage in `.sst/stage`.

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what SST does well)

- **Typed IaC-as-a-real-program on Pulumi/TF, MIT-licensed, no vendor state** — 150+ providers, deploys **from your machine into your account**, state local + S3 (**no Pulumi Cloud**, no CloudFormation limits). A clean OSS core.
- **Best-in-class high-level components for full-stack** — a Next.js/Remix/Astro app, a Fargate `Service`, a `Postgres`, an S3 `Bucket`, or a Stripe product in a few lines; a frontend component hides ~70 low-level resources. Genuine **full-stack** (frontend + container + serverless + data) in one config.
- **Linking + the typed `Resource` SDK** — inject config, generate types, and auto-grant IAM from one `link`, consumable in **JS/TS/Python/Go/Rust**. Excellent, low-ceremony resource binding.
- **Live Lambda dev (`sst dev`)** — genuinely novel: **proxy real cloud invocations to your local machine**, **<10ms** reload, **real IAM** in the loop. A high bar for local↔cloud fidelity that few match.
- **Console value in your own account** — zero-instrument **Issues** (auto errors + source maps), searchable logs, and **Autodeploy via CodeBuild in your account** with PR preview envs — CI/CD without shipping code to a vendor runtime.
- **Escape hatch is total** — any raw Pulumi/TF resource is one line away, so you're never boxed in by the high-level components.

### Gaps (SST's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **AWS-centric, not cloud-agnostic — despite "150+ providers."** The high-level portable components are overwhelmingly **`sst.aws.*`** (Cloudflare partial); the other 150 providers are **raw, provider-specific Pulumi/TF resources with no cross-cloud abstraction**. So SST is **multi-*provider*** (you can talk to anything) but **not multi-*cloud*** (the *same app* doesn't retarget clouds without rewriting to different resources). HoBo's ports have **cross-cloud equivalence classes** — one `bucket`/`sql`/`queue` maps to S3/GCS/Blob, RDS/Cloud SQL/Azure PG, etc. ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)/[ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)).
- **Pulumi-welded engine — no pluggable IaC.** SST *is* Pulumi (+ TF-via-Pulumi); you can't swap to Crossplane/OpenTofu/provider-native. HoBo keeps **IaC behind a port** — Pulumi is the *primary adapter*, with Crossplane/OpenTofu alongside ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)/[ADR-0069](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069)).
- **State is Pulumi snapshots, not an event-sourced control plane.** Local state + S3 + 30 snapshots gives *what* the infra is, not an auditable **who/why/when** you can replay. No event-sourcing, no time-travel, **no policy / `can-deploy` / contracts plane, no cost plane**. HoBo's control plane is **event-sourced + replayable** ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11)/[Plan 29](../design/contracts-policy-flags.md#plan-29)).
- **No platform-rules layer.** Component→resource mapping is fixed; "different infra per environment" is **imperative `if (stage===…)`** branching in the config program, not a recorded decision. HoBo adds **Resource Definitions + Matching** so a cheap-preview vs managed-HA-prod realization is an auditable **`match.Decided`** ([Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25)/[ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)), cost-routed by the **Dispatcher** ([ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)).
- **No AI-native story at the infra layer.** No MCP control surface, no agents-as-principals, no AI-generated providers/impls, no self-healing/trainable functions. (SST's AI energy is `opencode`, a standalone coding agent — orthogonal to the infra platform.) This is HoBo's entire thesis: generation pipeline ([Plan 23](../design/generated-stack.md#plan-23)), agents with SVIDs + `@hobo/mcp` ([Plan 6](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)), `"use training"` methods.
- **No reactive / live-query data model.** SST provisions Postgres/Dynamo/etc.; there's no Convex-style `useQuery()` that re-runs on write. HoBo has a first-class reactive read model ([Plan 32](../design/data-plane.md#plan-32)/[ADR-0050](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0050)).
- **Console is SaaS-only + per-resource pricing.** Autodeploy/Issues/logs/preview envs live in the paid Console; self-host is *"planned,"* not shipped; cost scales with resource count ($0.086/resource). HoBo's **Yard is itself a Bindle** (self-host = hosted parity, [Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)); metering/showback is **OSS FinOps**, no billing ([ADR-0039](../design/adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0039)).
- **Config authoring is TypeScript-only.** `sst.config.ts` must be TS (runtime SDK covers 4 languages, but the infra program doesn't). HoBo authors against **language-neutral WIT** in any Component-Model language ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)).
- **Live dev needs a real cloud + deployed stubs.** `sst dev` is high-fidelity but **can't run fully offline** and mutates a real account; there's no labeled simulate/mock tier. HoBo formalizes a **fidelity matrix** (simulate/mock/Camp-only) with **`hobo verify`** splitting local vs Camp checks ([ADR-0042](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042)).
- **Greenfield-leaning; no adopt-in-place.** Onboarding means writing `sst.config.ts` (you *can* wrap raw providers, but there's no **estate import**). HoBo's **`hobo import`** adopts existing TF/Pulumi/Lakebed/FaaS estates in place ([ADR-0041](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0041)).
- **No multi-tenant-app primitives, no cross-cloud data migration/consistency.** Same shape as Encore — a SaaS builder rolls their own tenancy; single-account means no portability/consistency model. HoBo ships tenancy ([Plan 50](../design/security-networking.md#plan-50)) + app-data migration ([ADR-0032](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0032)) + cross-Camp consistency ([ADR-0040](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0040)).

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** SST is **typed-IaC-as-a-Pulumi-program + rich full-stack components + Live dev**, **AWS-centric**, with **no AI/agents, no event-sourcing, no reactive data, no platform-rules layer, no pluggable IaC**. HoBo is **agnostic ports + pluggable IaC under an IfC layer + a language-neutral wasm runtime + event-sourced governance + AI-native depth**. SST is the sharpest validation that **Pulumi/TF as the provisioning substrate + Linking-style typed resource binding + local-first deploy** are right — HoBo adopts all three and keeps the IaC engine behind a port.
- **vs Nitric:** both are "cloud-ish IfC," but differently — **Nitric** is *run-to-collect* with **truly portable ports** (one app → AWS/GCP/Azure/K8s, no rewrite); **SST** is an *explicit Pulumi program*, **AWS-centric**, with **richer full-stack components + Live dev**. Nitric's own docs frame it: *"SST is AWS + Pulumi, opinionated full-stack AWS."* HoBo takes Nitric's portable ports **and** SST's component/full-stack ergonomics.
- **vs Encore:** both **deploy into your own cloud account** with great local DX. **Encore** parses infra declarations with its **compiler** (IfC, opinionated, AWS/GCP, real-infra local, Rust runtime); **SST** builds an explicit **Pulumi** graph (150+ providers, Live-Lambda local). Encore *owns* provisioning via its compiler; SST via Pulumi. Neither is truly multi-cloud-portable or AI-native.
- **vs Pulumi / CDK / Terraform:** SST is a **higher-level, opinionated layer *on top of* Pulumi** (itself on TF providers). v3 explicitly **replaced CDK/CloudFormation** to escape CFN's stack/resource limits and slow, cloud-side deploys. It's "**IaC with batteries + app-linking + Live dev**," not a new IaC engine. HoBo agrees with "keep IaC, add an IfC layer" — but treats the engine as a **swappable adapter**, not the foundation.
- **vs Convex/Supabase:** SST gives you **infrastructure**, not a batteries-included reactive backend — no live queries, no built-in auth/data conventions beyond the components you wire. Closer to HoBo's "compose it from ports" stance than to Convex's single-backend model.

**Net:** SST is one of HoBo's closest **product-shaped** competitors on **authoring ergonomics + local DX**, and — like Encore — the gap is **everything HoBo adds around the IfC/IaC core**: genuine cloud-agnostic portable ports, pluggable IaC, a language-neutral wasm runtime, Resource Definitions/Matching + the Dispatcher, event-sourced governance (cost/policy/contracts), a reactive data plane, cross-cloud data, multi-tenant-app primitives, adopt-in-place import, and AI-native depth (generation pipeline, agents-as-principals, trainable functions).

### SST-as-validation, and the borrowings HoBo takes

SST validates three HoBo bets at production scale: **(1) Pulumi/TF as the provisioning substrate** — exactly HoBo's primary IaC adapter ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)), except HoBo keeps it behind a port rather than welding to it; **(2) typed resource *Linking*** — inject config + generate types + auto-IAM from one declaration — which HoBo generalizes into triple-effect `.allow()` ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)) + checked-in `_generated/` bindings ([ADR-0037](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0037)); and **(3) local-first deploy with real-cloud fidelity** (`sst dev` proxying real invocations to your machine) — a strong argument for HoBo's Camp-only fidelity tier ([ADR-0042](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042)). The one ergonomic HoBo explicitly does **not** copy is SST's **infra-as-a-separate-program**: HoBo declares resources **inline where they're used** (Nitric-style run-to-collect), so there's no config↔app split to keep in sync.

### The one-line takeaway

**SST proves HoBo's Pulumi/TF substrate + typed-linking DX + local-first-with-real-cloud-fidelity in production** — but is **AWS-centric, Pulumi-welded, snapshot-stated, and not AI-native**, with no portable cross-cloud ports, no platform-rules layer, no reactive data, and a SaaS-only Console. HoBo's differentiation is the surrounding system: **genuinely cloud-agnostic ports + pluggable IaC, a language-neutral wasm runtime, Resource Definitions/Matching + the Dispatcher, a reactive data plane + broad data paradigms, event-sourced governance (cost/policy/contracts), cross-cloud data, multi-tenant-app primitives, adopt-in-place import, and AI-native depth.**
