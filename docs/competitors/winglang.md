# Winglang — competitor reference

> A faithful capture of **Winglang (Wing)** for HoBo competitive analysis. Wing is a **cloud-oriented programming language** — not a framework inside an existing language (Nitric/Encore) but a **new language** whose type system splits **preflight** (infrastructure, evaluated at compile time) from **inflight** (runtime code, compiled to JavaScript), compiling to **Terraform (CDKTF)** or **AWS CDK/CloudFormation**. It is the most literal expression of the **cloud-agnostic authoring** thesis HoBo shares — a head-on-ish competitor on the *authoring model* (like Nitric). Sources: [winglang.io](https://www.winglang.io/) · [winglang.io/docs](https://www.winglang.io/docs/) (concepts/[inflights](https://www.winglang.io/docs/concepts/inflights)) · [github.com/winglang/wing](https://github.com/winglang/wing) · standard library ([cloud.Bucket](https://www.winglang.io/docs/api/standard-library/cloud/bucket)/[cloud.Queue](https://www.winglang.io/docs/api/standard-library/cloud/queue)/[cloud.Function](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/function)) · [Wing Console](https://www.winglang.io/docs/tools/wing-console). **Status (honest):** Wing Cloud, the company, [announced its shutdown on 2025-04-09](https://www.winglang.io/blog/2025/04/09/shutdown); the language remains MIT open source but is **pre-release** (the README states *"🚧 This is a pre-release"*), the last release was **v0.85.49 (2025-02-03)**, the hosted docs site has been [reported down](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/7263) (2025-06), and the community itself has publicly asked whether [the project is abandoned](https://github.com/winglang/wing/discussions/7225). It shipped a *real*, working language + simulator + a 100+ contributor community — credit it against HoBo's design-phase status. License **MIT**.

## What it is

Winglang (**Wing**, files `.w`) is an **open-source (MIT) programming language for the cloud**, created by **Elad Ben-Israel** (author of AWS CDK), the **Wing Cloud** team, and community contributors ("Wingnuts"). Its thesis: *infrastructure and application code are one program.* Instead of writing IaC (Terraform/CDK/Pulumi) in one place and runtime code in another, you write **one Wing program** with two execution phases the compiler distinguishes and type-checks:

- **Preflight** — code that runs **once, at compile time**, to produce the **infrastructure configuration** of your app (Terraform JSON via CDK for Terraform, or CloudFormation via AWS CDK). Instantiating `new cloud.Bucket()` is preflight — it declares infra.
- **Inflight** — code (marked `inflight`) that is **compiled to JavaScript** and runs **at runtime** inside cloud compute (Lambda/containers, Node.js). Handling a queue message or an API request is inflight.

You `bring cloud;` and instantiate **first-class cloud resources** (`cloud.Bucket`, `cloud.Queue`, `cloud.Function`, `cloud.Counter`, `cloud.Topic`, `cloud.Api`, `cloud.Schedule`, …); an inflight closure that **captures** a preflight resource is automatically wired — Wing **infers the least-privilege IAM** from *which methods the inflight actually calls*, with no explicit grant statement. One program compiles to multiple **targets/platforms**: `sim` (a local, in-process cloud **simulator**), `tf-aws`/`tf-azure`/`tf-gcp` (Terraform), and `awscdk` (CloudFormation). Local development runs against the `sim` target with the **Wing Console** (`wing it`) — a visual, hot-reloading operations UI.

The mental model is the same **authoring-time IfC** idea HoBo adopts ([Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21)) — declare what the app needs where you use it, and the toolchain provisions it — but taken to its maximal form: a **new language** where the preflight/inflight split is a *language primitive*, not a convention. That split is the single closest external analog to HoBo's own separation of **authoring-time IfC** from a **wasm runtime** ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)/[ADR-0069](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069)) — except HoBo reaches it **without asking anyone to adopt a new language**.

**Honest status.** Wing is not vaporware — it shipped a coherent language, a genuinely good simulator/console, a cloud-portable standard library, and a real community. But the bet did not become a business: **Wing Cloud shut down in April 2025** (founded April 2022; **$20M seed**, July 2023), the founder citing that *"while developer experience is something engineers care deeply about, it's not always seen as business-critical by most companies."* The language is MIT and *"the ideas will hopefully live on, just not as a business concern"*; a maintainer stated intent to *"keep Winglang open in the long term,"* but active development has largely wound down (last release Feb 2025, docs site reported down, community asking if it is abandoned). This makes Wing simultaneously HoBo's **cleanest authoring-model validation** and its **sharpest cautionary tale**.

| Dimension | Wing |
|---|---|
| Authoring | **A new programming language** (Wing, `.w`) — infra + runtime unified in one program |
| Core primitive | **preflight** (compile-time → IaC) / **inflight** (`inflight` modifier → JavaScript at runtime), enforced by the type system |
| Resources | `cloud.*` standard library — `Bucket`, `Queue`, `Topic`, `Function`, `Counter`, `Api`, `Schedule`, `Secret`, `Website`, … via `bring cloud` |
| Permissions | **inferred automatically** from inflight *capture + method calls* (no explicit `.allow()`) — least-privilege IAM synthesized by the compiler |
| Runtime | **inflight → JavaScript on Node.js** (single runtime language) |
| Compile targets | `sim` · `tf-aws` · `tf-azure` · `tf-gcp` (Terraform / CDKTF) · `awscdk` (AWS CDK → CloudFormation) |
| Provisioning engine | **Terraform (CDKTF) or AWS CDK** — Wing does **not** provision itself; **no other IaC** (no Pulumi/Crossplane/OpenTofu) |
| Local dev | **in-process simulator (`sim`)** + **Wing Console** (`wing it`: hot reload, resource map/explorer, logs, test runner) — no LocalStack/Docker |
| Interop | `bring` npm / **JSII** modules; SDK is TypeScript, exported via JSII to Python/Go/Java |
| Testing | `test "…" { }` blocks execute against the simulator (or any target) |
| License / status | **MIT**; **pre-release** (v0.85.x, last release 2025-02-03); **Wing Cloud company shut down 2025-04-09**; OSS project largely paused/community |
| Company | Wing Cloud — founded Apr 2022, **$20M seed (Jul 2023)**, **shut down Apr 2025** |

## Feature surface

### Preflight / inflight — the two-phase model

Wing's defining feature. Code is either **preflight** (default; infrastructure, evaluated at compile time) or **inflight** (marked with the `inflight` modifier; runtime, compiled to JavaScript). A single class can hold both — preflight fields/constructors that stand up infra, and inflight methods that run against it. Preflight methods like `queue.setConsumer(...)` *configure infrastructure* to invoke a given inflight function per message:

```wing
bring cloud;

// preflight: infrastructure, evaluated once at compile time
let bucket  = new cloud.Bucket();
let counter = new cloud.Counter();
let queue   = new cloud.Queue();

// setConsumer is a PREFLIGHT method that wires an INFLIGHT handler onto the queue
queue.setConsumer(inflight (message: str) => {
  let i = counter.inc();               // runtime (inflight)
  bucket.put("wing-{i}.txt", message); // string interpolation with { }
});
```

An `inflight` closure can be handed straight to a `cloud.Function` (the FaaS primitive):

```wing
bring cloud;
let countWords = new cloud.Function(inflight (s: str): str => {
  return "{s.split(" ").length}";
});
```

Inflight bodies use the resource's runtime API — e.g. bucket I/O:

```wing
bucket.put("file.txt", "Hello, world!");
bucket.putJson("person.json", Json { name: "Alice" });
let data = bucket.get("file.txt");
```

### Cloud resources — the portable standard library (`bring cloud`)

`bring cloud;` imports Wing's **cloud-portable standard library** of first-class resources — the same code compiles to whichever target you pick, and the platform implementation maps each resource to a provider-native service. Representative resources: **`cloud.Bucket`** (object storage), **`cloud.Queue`** (pull, with `setConsumer`), **`cloud.Topic`** (pub/sub), **`cloud.Function`** (FaaS), **`cloud.Counter`** (atomic counter), **`cloud.Api`** (HTTP), **`cloud.Schedule`** (cron/interval), **`cloud.Secret`**, **`cloud.Website`**. Other namespaces (`bring util;`, `bring ex;`, `bring math;`, `bring http;`) round out the library; `bring "<npm-pkg>" as x;` pulls in JavaScript/JSII modules.

### Automatic permissions (capture-based IAM)

Wing's headline ergonomic: **you never write IAM.** When an inflight closure **captures** a preflight resource, the compiler reflects on *which methods the inflight calls at runtime* and **synthesizes the minimal IAM** for exactly those operations (calling `bucket.put(...)` grants write, and nothing more). This is even lower-ceremony than Nitric/Encore's explicit `.allow(...)` — the grant is *inferred from usage*. **Caveat (from Wing's own docs):** *imported* resources (raw npm/JSII/cloud-SDK objects) are opaque to the compiler, so their permissions **cannot** be inferred automatically — the automatic-IAM guarantee holds only for native `cloud.*` resources.

### The simulator (`sim`) + Wing Console

Wing ships an **in-process cloud simulator** as a first-class compile target (`-t sim`): the whole app — buckets, queues, functions, counters, schedules — runs locally, in memory, *"for testing and debugging in milliseconds,"* with no internet, no LocalStack, no Docker. The **Wing Console** (`wing it`) is a visual web UI over the simulated app: an **Explorer** and a **Map view** (a live architecture diagram of resources and their relationships), a **resource-interaction panel** (click a bucket to upload/inspect files; publish to a topic; trigger a schedule), a **Logs view**, and an integrated **test runner** — all **hot-reloading** on every save. This fast, high-fidelity local loop is Wing's strongest single feature.

### Compile targets / platforms & the CLI

One program, many targets — selected with `-t`/`--target`. Wing does **not** provision infrastructure itself: it **synthesizes** IaC (Terraform via CDK for Terraform, or CloudFormation via AWS CDK) that you then apply with the corresponding engine.

```bash
wing compile main.w -t sim       # local simulator (in-process)
wing compile main.w -t tf-aws    # Terraform for AWS   (also: tf-azure, tf-gcp)
wing compile main.w -t awscdk    # AWS CDK -> CloudFormation
wing it                          # run on `sim` and open the Wing Console (hot reload)
wing test  main.w -t tf-aws      # run `test "..." {}` blocks against a target
```

```wing
test "enqueue then consume" {
  queue.push("hello");
  // assertions execute against the local simulator (sim) in milliseconds
}
```

### Interop & language lineage

Wing's SDK is written in **TypeScript** and exported via **JSII** (the same tech behind AWS CDK) so it can be consumed from Python/Go/Java — Wing itself can `bring` any npm/JSII module, and JSII constructs are treated as preflight classes. This gives Wing an **escape hatch** to the entire JS/CDK ecosystem, but (per the caveat above) at the cost of automatic IAM inference for those imported objects. The lineage is direct: Wing is, in effect, "what the AWS CDK author built next" — CDK-style constructs, but as a language with a runtime phase.

### Project status (honest)

- **Company shut down.** Wing Cloud [announced its shutdown on **2025-04-09**](https://www.winglang.io/blog/2025/04/09/shutdown), ~2 years after a **$20M seed** (Jul 2023). Founder Elad Ben-Israel: *"while developer experience is something engineers care deeply about, it's not always seen as business-critical by most companies"*; and *"we explored various different directions … in the end, we didn't find the right fit."*
- **Language is OSS but pre-release.** MIT-licensed; README banner: *"🚧 This is a pre-release."* Last release **v0.85.49 (2025-02-03)**; ~5.4k GitHub stars, 100+ contributors.
- **Maintenance uncertain.** A maintainer wrote (2024-12-15) *"we plan to keep Winglang open in the long term, as almost all programming languages are,"* but a community member later (2025-06) asked *"is it still the case? The project seems abandoned,"* and the hosted **docs site has been reported down**. Treat production adoption as carrying **real project-viability risk**.

## Differentiators

### Strengths (what Wing does well)

- **The purest articulation of "infra and runtime are one program."** Not a framework bolted onto a host language — a **language** where the **preflight/inflight** phase split is a type-system primitive. Conceptually the cleanest cloud-authoring model in the field.
- **Automatic, capture-based least-privilege IAM** — permissions **inferred** from what inflight code actually does; no `.allow()`, no policy JSON. The most ergonomic permission story in the category.
- **Best-in-class local loop** — an **in-process simulator** ("milliseconds," no Docker/LocalStack) plus the **Wing Console** (`wing it`: live architecture map, resource interaction, logs, test runner, hot reload). This is the bar for "works locally predicts works in prod."
- **Cloud-portable standard library** (`cloud.*`) compiling to **Terraform (AWS/Azure/GCP)** or **AWS CDK** — one program, multiple clouds/engines.
- **A real, shipped artifact** with a 100+ contributor community and CDK-author pedigree — credit it honestly against HoBo's design-phase status.

### Gaps (Wing's limits — HoBo's opening)

- **It's a NEW LANGUAGE — the adoption cost is the whole ballgame.** Using Wing means writing `.w`, retraining the team, and leaving behind your existing TS/Go/Python/Rust code, mature editor/debugger tooling, libraries, and hiring pool. Wing's *own post-mortem* points at this ("the market might not have been ready to adopt an entirely new language"). HoBo authors in **WIT over any wasm-compiling language** ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)/[ADR-0069](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069)/[ADR-0072](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0072)) — **no new language, no rewrite**.
- **Compiles to Terraform/CloudFormation only — no pluggable IaC.** The provisioning engine is fixed to **CDKTF or AWS CDK**; you cannot swap in **Pulumi/Crossplane/OpenTofu**, nor pin specific resources to specific engines. HoBo keeps IaC tools as **pluggable adapters *under* the authoring layer** ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)/[ADR-0006](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0006)).
- **Inflight runs as JavaScript on Node.js only.** JSII gives multi-language *authoring of the SDK*, but the **runtime** is single-language JS. HoBo's runtime is **language-neutral wasm components** behind WIT ([Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20)/[ADR-0031](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0031)).
- **No durable, event-sourced runtime.** Inflight handlers are stateless FaaS-style functions; there is **no actor / durable-workflow / event-store / replay** model. HoBo's runtime is **durable + event-sourced** ([Plan 11](../design/data-plane.md#plan-11)/[ADR-0003](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0003)/[ADR-0004](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0004)/[ADR-0050](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0050)).
- **No AI-native / agent story.** No agents-as-principals, no MCP control surface, no AI generation pipeline, no trainable functions. HoBo is AI-native by design — agents carry SVIDs + MCP ([Plan 6](../design/ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06)) and a generation pipeline authors providers/impls ([Plan 23](../design/generated-stack.md#plan-23)/[ADR-0010](../design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0010)).
- **No control-plane governance.** The `cloud.*`→provider mapping is fixed by the target platform (tunable, not redefinable) — there is **no "same app, different infra per environment, auditably"**, no cost/policy/contracts planes, no platform RBAC. HoBo adds **Resource Definitions + Matching** ([Plan 25](../design/platform-engineering.md#plan-25)/[ADR-0033](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0033)) — a realization is a recorded `match.Decided` — and the credit/budget-aware **Dispatcher** ([ADR-0071](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0071)), plus contracts/`can-deploy` + policy planes ([Plan 29](../design/contracts-policy-flags.md#plan-29)).
- **No multi-tenant-app primitives, no cross-cloud data story** (migration/portability/consistency) — and **no adopt-in-place onboarding** (Wing is greenfield-by-construction: a new language). HoBo ships `hobo import` for existing TF/Pulumi/FaaS estates ([ADR-0041](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0041)).
- **Project-viability risk is now *realized*, not hypothetical.** The **company is gone (Apr 2025)**, the language is **pre-release** and largely paused, and the docs site has been reported down. This is the sharpest reminder that **great DX ≠ a sustainable platform** — precisely why HoBo is **OSS with self-host = hosted parity** and keeps monetization out of design scope ([Plan 4](../design/control-plane.md#plan-04)/[ADR-0064](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)).

### Comparisons

- **vs HoBo:** Wing = a **new language** unifying infra+runtime, compiling to TF/CDK, JS runtime, superb simulator; HoBo = **no new language** (WIT over any wasm language), **pluggable IaC**, a **durable event-sourced** runtime, **AI-native**, and **governed**. Wing's **preflight/inflight** split is the closest external analog to HoBo's **authoring-time IfC vs wasm runtime** split — HoBo achieves the same separation *without forcing a language change*. Wing's `sim` + Console is the bar `hobo dev` targets; HoBo formalizes it as a **fidelity matrix** (simulate/mock/Camp-only) with `hobo verify` ([ADR-0042](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042)).
- **vs Nitric:** both are cloud-agnostic authoring. Nitric is an **SDK inside existing languages** (Node/Python/Go/Dart) over a gRPC membrane with **explicit `.allow()`**; Wing is a **whole language** with **inferred** permissions. Nitric keeps your language; Wing replaces it — HoBo keeps your language *and* infers/unifies effects via `.allow()` (IAM + wasm link + token).
- **vs Encore:** Encore is an **IfC SDK in TS/Go** that provisions **AWS/GCP directly**; Wing is a **language** that **synthesizes TF/CDK**. Both have fixed provisioning — but **Encore is a live business**, while **Wing's company has shut down**.
- **vs Pulumi / CDK / Terraform:** Wing sits **above** them (it *compiles to* CDKTF/AWS CDK; its author built AWS CDK). HoBo agrees with "author above IaC" but keeps those engines as **pluggable adapters**, broader than Wing's fixed TF/CDK.
- **vs SST/Ion:** SST is TypeScript-on-Pulumi, AWS-centric; Wing is a cross-cloud language. HoBo is **language-neutral + multi-cloud + pluggable-IaC**.
- **vs wasm hosts (Spin/wasmCloud):** Wing has **no wasm runtime** story (inflight is JS); HoBo's runtime **is** wasm components ([`wasm-hosts.md`](wasm-hosts.md)).

**Net:** Wing is the **purest expression of the cloud-agnostic authoring thesis**, and its **preflight/inflight** phase split validates HoBo's authoring-vs-runtime separation more cleanly than any competitor — but it makes the **maximal bet** (a *new language*), ships a **JS-only runtime** compiling to **TF/CDK only**, has **no durable/event-sourced/AI-native/governed** layers, and — decisively — **its company shut down in April 2025**, leaving a pre-release, community-uncertain artifact. HoBo takes the same authoring idea **without the language tax** (WIT over any wasm language), adds pluggable IaC, a durable event-sourced runtime, AI-native depth, and control-plane governance — and its **OSS + self-host = hosted** model is designed to survive exactly the sustainability failure Wing hit.

### Wing-as-validation, and the honest caution

Wing is the **strongest external evidence for HoBo's authoring model**: an independent team led by the AWS CDK author concluded that the right shape is **one program that separates infrastructure (preflight) from runtime (inflight)**, with **portable cloud primitives** and a **fast local simulator** — exactly HoBo's [Plan 21](../design/authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21) + [Plan 20](../design/wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20) split and the `hobo dev` fidelity matrix ([ADR-0042](../design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042)). The divergence is deliberate and, in hindsight, load-bearing: Wing paid for that model with a **new language** (maximal adoption cost) and bound itself to a **JS runtime + TF/CDK synth**, then **the company failed to find a market**. HoBo takes the validated idea and **removes the language tax** (WIT over any wasm language, [ADR-0069](../design/adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069)), **broadens the substrate** (pluggable IaC + wasm runtime), and **hardens the surroundings** (durable event-sourcing, AI-native, governance) — while its OSS/self-host-parity posture is aimed squarely at the sustainability problem that ended Wing.

### The one-line takeaway

**Wing proves HoBo's preflight/inflight-style authoring split and local-simulator DX are the right instincts** — and, by shutting down its company in April 2025, also proves the trap HoBo is designed to avoid: a **new-language** bet with a **JS-only runtime**, **TF/CDK-only** provisioning, **no durable/AI-native/governed** layers, and **no sustainable model**. HoBo keeps the authoring insight, drops the language, and adds the entire meta-cloud system around it: **WIT-over-any-language + pluggable IaC + a durable event-sourced runtime + AI-native depth + control-plane governance, OSS with self-host = hosted.**
