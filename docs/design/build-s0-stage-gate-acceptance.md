# Build S0 Stage Gate Acceptance

Source issue: [HOBO-589](https://linear.app/quickdeploy-ai/issue/HOBO-589/s0-12-stage-gate-s0-signed-hello-bindle-component-through-ci-all).

Executable proof for this acceptance record is **not** a `src/draft/` package. The runnable
signals are:

- `.github/workflows/stage-gate-s0.yml` (green on `main` means S0 is done)
- `packages/stage-gate/` unit and consumer-contract tests (`pnpm --filter @hobo/stage-gate test`)

CI builds `@hobo/stage-gate` and its workspace dependencies (notably `@hobo/componentize` for the
hello-bindle fixture scripts) via `turbo run build --filter @hobo/stage-gate...`, then invokes
`node packages/stage-gate/dist/cli.js run s0` (workspace bins are not linked at the repo root until
the package is a declared dependency). Failed runs still
upload `stage-gate-s0.record.json` as a workflow artifact (`if: always()`). The workflow installs
`cue` via `cue-lang/setup-cue@v1.0.0` (v0.14.0, matching `hobo-ci.yml`) because
`pnpm run test:schema` includes `@hobo/bindles` CUE vet gates, and normalizes LF line endings with
`git reset --hard` after checkout so Windows legs match checked-in generated artifacts. The gate
step runs under `bash` on all matrix OS legs and re-runs `git reset --hard` immediately before
`hobo-stage-gate`; schema-tools and wit-toolchain drift checks compare LF-normalized generated text
so Windows buf/jco output does not false-positive against Linux-checked-in files. WIT skeleton parsing
normalizes CRLF to LF before matching interface blocks so Windows checkouts do not skip
`scope_creep_filled_interfaces` guards.

## Scope In

- `@hobo/stage-gate` runner that executes and records the S0 toolchain check list fail-closed.
- `StageGateRecord` protobuf + CUE contract in `packages/stage-gate/data-models/`.
- Stage-gate CI workflow with Ubuntu/Windows matrix digest equality assertion.
- This acceptance record, design index row, and traceability row.

## Scope Out

- Implementing the underlying gates (boundary lint, architecture guard, schema drift, PACT harness,
  conformance harness, hello-bindle fixture, signing pipeline) — owned by S0-01..S0-11.
- `camp`-tag cloud E2E, registry lifecycle, Sigstore transparency-log lookup, key rotation.

## Proof Expectations

- Parser rejects malformed or internally inconsistent records (`parseStageGateRecord`).
- Runner fails closed on any non-zero check exit code.
- Tampered artifact verification is recorded as refused in the negative check.
- Cross-OS matrix legs report identical `sha256:` component digests when S0-11 production fixture is available.

## Maintenance

Promotion note: stage-gate check scripts use `@hobo/componentize` for hello-bindle build/smoke
checks and fall back to the draft hello-bindle fixture path only when
`examples/hello-bindle` is absent. Signing verification scripts still orchestrate the draft
`signed-artifact-publish-install-contract` until `packages/componentize` publishes
`artifact-trust` on main. Cross-OS digest parity compares uploaded stage-gate record
artifacts from Ubuntu and Windows matrix legs.
