# HoBo CLI Specification

This document is the canonical command contract for `@hobo/cli`. It keeps the CLI
small while preserving the design suite's role model: app developers and agents
drive one shared command path, while platform, policy, delivery, SRE, and
generation behavior are authored as SDK code or exposed through dashboard/MCP
surfaces.

## Canonical CLI Verbs

| Verb | Role | Semantics | Implementation issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| `up` | lifecycle | Realize the current object graph: build, plan, gate, provision, and deploy. `--camp`, `--strategy`, `--to`, `--rollback`, `--seed`, and `--restore` select target or revision without adding lifecycle verbs. `--broker` / `--broker-uri` target a remote broker (discovery required); `--anonymous` / `--temporary` request an ephemeral deploy when discovery advertises support. No flags = local embedded broker (zero-config, offline). | HOBO-130, HOBO-164, HOBO-198, HOBO-203, HOBO-208, HOBO-213, HOBO-219, HOBO-224 |
| `down` | lifecycle | Tear down what `up` realized, in reverse dependency order. | HOBO-132 |
| `dev` | local loop | Run against `runtime-local` with hot reload, replay, codegen-in-watch, and honest fidelity labels. Every workload lane participates: wasm components in any supported language recompile in-watch and OCI-fallback services restart-on-change per the dev-loop matrix ([ADR-0109](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0109)). | HOBO-122, HOBO-190, HOBO-198, HOBO-392, HOBO-612 (draft POC: `src/draft/technical-proofs/hobo-612-dev-local-loop-poc/`) |
| `new` | local loop | Scaffold a runnable SDK program. | HOBO-118, HOBO-198 |
| `login` | identity | Obtain a dev SVID through OIDC; never paste provider keys. Optional `--broker` / `--broker-uri` associates a default remote broker on the HOBO_HOME profile (identity plane; not placement). | HOBO-136, HOBO-184 |
| `connection` | identity | Manage durable Station-owned Connections (create/authorize/list/get/revoke/rotate). Scoped by `--station` / profile.defaultStation. | HOBO-connection, ADR-0131 |
| `identity` | identity | Observe continuous identity migration (status/inspect). Zero Bindle config; Matching + dual fixtures drive dual-path. | ADR-0132 |
| `trails` | migration | Observe continuous migration Trails (`status`, `plan`, `inspect`). App-owned recipes; identity continuous stays zero Bindle config (`identity.continuous` compose). | ADR-0134 |
| `access` | identity | Request elevated or cross-env access / break-glass (short-lived capability; audited). | ADR-0133 |
| `feature` | delivery | OpenFeature flags, canary, and experiment observe (`list`, `eval`, `set`, `kill`, `canary`, `experiment`). Sole app evaluation API is OpenFeature; no vendor SDKs. | ADR-0044, ADR-0083 |
| `deploy` | delivery | Attested continuous delivery (`status`, `logs`, `rollback`). Secret-free status; no ambient credentials. | ADR-0083, ADR-0008 |
| `incident` | delivery | CD failure disposition (`status`, `open` for A2H or sandboxed self-heal). Default A2H; self-heal only in ADR-0076 lane. | ADR-0082, ADR-0094, ADR-0076 |
| `claim` | identity | Bind an anonymous `npx hobo up` deployment to an account while preserving state and URL. Local: event-store rebind. Remote: `hobo claim <account> --broker <uri> --token <claimToken>` exchanges the claim token without re-provision. | HOBO-136, HOBO-164 |
| `plan` | read-only | Dry-run the `up` decision: DeploymentPlan, Matching choices, cost, and warnings as an approvable diff. | HOBO-125, HOBO-203, HOBO-208 |
| `verify` | read-only | Optional preflight for the unified Gatekeeper decision. `up` still runs the same gate automatically before mutation. | HOBO-146, HOBO-227 |
| `can-deploy` | read-only | Compatibility-matrix diagnostic for producer/consumer skew; an input to `verify` and `up`. | HOBO-123, HOBO-146 |
| `inspect` | read-only | Render projections and time-travel views such as `run`, `deploy`, and `topology`. | HOBO-140, HOBO-216 |
| `logs` | read-only | Live-tail logs and streams through the Camp runtime Streamer. | HOBO-143, HOBO-216 |
| `doctor` | diagnostics | Report environment, credential, connectivity, and portability hazards. | HOBO-147, HOBO-184, HOBO-190 |
| `messaging` | diagnostics | Inspect messaging capability + delivery-guarantee readiness (Kafka/Redpanda, optional Dapr Camp runtime); pure readiness section also surfaces in `hobo doctor`. | ADR-0138 |
| `codegen` | authoring | Regenerate checked-in `_generated/`; `--check` fails on drift. | HOBO-152 |
| `build` | authoring | Compile services to wasm components with an OCI fallback; fails on generated drift. | HOBO-156 |
| `collect` | authoring | Run resource collection and print the provider-agnostic manifest IR. | HOBO-160 |
| `stub` | authoring | Run with a contract-backed stub behind a WIT port while implementation is generated or deferred. | HOBO-160, HOBO-392 |
| `drift` | diagnostics | Report drift and route governed remediation through proposals or gated `up` convergence. | HOBO-216, HOBO-369 |
| `add` | distribution | Install a provider/listing as available to deterministic selection after signature, provenance, and conformance checks. | HOBO-362, HOBO-365 |
| `registry` | distribution | Registry administration subcommands, including signed offline bundle import for air-gapped Yards. | HOBO-350, HOBO-383 |
| `import` | migration | Adopt an existing estate in place as adopted/external resources; never destroy/recreate on import. | HOBO-225, HOBO-369 |
| `generate` | generation | Request the provider-generation loop for a backend/capability; certification still passes through conformance and Registry. | HOBO-207, HOBO-348 |
| `sandbox` | test loop | Run a system-under-test in an isolated lane with out-of-scope boundaries served from contracts. | HOBO-190, HOBO-392 |
| `test` | test loop | Alias for the contract-backed sandbox test lane; not a replacement for project test runners. | HOBO-190, HOBO-392 |

| `attest` | governance | Produce signed OCSF, control, or model-card evidence exports from replayable audit facts for external GRC tools. | HOBO-175, HOBO-196, HOBO-282 |
| `erase` | governance | Request crypto-shred erasure and projection rebuild for a data subject without rewriting historical events. | HOBO-295 |
| `broker` | governance | The broker (the Conductor) on the CLI. Requires Station context when available (profile / `HOBO_STATION` / `--station`); receipts pin `stationId` + `railHash`. `broker config [--init]` scaffolds/validates `hobo.broker.json` (importable as a Rail under a Station); `broker up [--config --request]` assembles the Conductor against Station + active Rail + local-host catalog when no cloud config; `broker resolve --policies --request` runs one resolution; `broker matrix` prints the closed rejection-code catalog. App lifecycle stays `up`/`down`. | HOBO-521, HOBO-525, HOBO-528, HOBO-529 |
| `serve` | control plane (local) | **Local control-plane HTTP+SSE** for the Yard game UI (`hobo serve control`). Same management surface as station/connection verbs; default `127.0.0.1:8790`. | ADR-0135 |
| `station` | control plane (ops/setup) | **Station occupancy setup/ops family — not a lifecycle verb.** `station init` creates a Station under `HOBO_HOME` with a sealed bootstrap Rail and sets `profile.defaultStation` (imports existing `hobo.broker.json` as an approved Rail when present); `station up` / `station down` start/stop occupancy (data retained on down); `station status` projects isolation, active Rail hash, bootstrap-active, Connection counts; `station rails` manages Rails (`list`, `publish`, `approve`, `activate`, `status`). Missing Station fails closed with remediation `hobo station init`. | ADR-0131 |
| `replay` | observability | **Session Replay** (DOM/session reconstruction on every **App Kit**) — subcommands `list`, `get`, `open`, `summarize`, `retention`, `doctor`. Distinct from control-plane event-log replay and auth `session.*`. Local dual fixtures default-on for all App Kits (not only `web`); production flag/sample gated; `HOBO_REPLAY=0` kill switch. MCP parity via CANONICAL_VERBS. | ADR-0137 |
| `derivative` | extensibility | Manage derived HoBo implementations; `derivative upgrade` checks descriptors, runs upcasters, and reruns conformance. | HOBO-36, HOBO-336, HOBO-386 |
| `runbook` | SRE | Execute or replay declarative incident runbooks; write actions still pass through policy obligations. | HOBO-260, HOBO-285 |


## Coding harness binary (`hobo-code`)

The coding harness is **not** a `hobo <verb>` entry. It ships as a separate binary:

```bash
hobo-code [flags] [<verb>] [args]
hobo-code [flags] <prompt...>   # default verb: dispatch
```

Package: `@hobo/code` / composition-root bin from `@hobo/hobo`. Flat verbs: `dispatch` (default), `status`, `session`, `scaffold`, `isolate`, `promote`, `budget`, `remote`, `platform`, `join`, `agent`, `nodes`, `rooms`, `help`. Distributed compute (block/buzz-inspired hive) is folded into those verbs — there is **no** nested `buzz` verb. See [ADR-0139](./adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0139) and [hobo-code-isolation-runbook.md](./hobo-code-isolation-runbook.md).

## Station context resolution

For `station`, `broker`, `connection`, `up`, and `login --station`:

1. `--station` / `--station-uri`
2. `HOBO_STATION` / `HOBO_STATION_URI`
3. `profile.defaultStation`
4. Fail closed with remediation `hobo station init`. Never silently create durable Station state.

## Lifecycle Semantics

`up` and `down` are the only lifecycle verbs. `station` is an ops/setup family like `broker` / `connection` / `registry` — never a second lifecycle. `up` subsumes deploy,
promotion, rollback, self-host bootstrap, and restore through flags:

```bash
hobo up
hobo up --camp prod
hobo up --camp prod --to <revision>
hobo up --rollback
hobo up ./platform --seed
hobo up ./platform --restore <log>
hobo up --broker https://broker.example.com
hobo up --broker-uri https://broker.example.com
hobo up --broker https://public.example.com --anonymous
hobo up --broker https://public.example.com --temporary
hobo login --broker https://broker.example.com
hobo claim acme
hobo claim acme --to acme
hobo claim acme --broker https://public.example.com --token <claimToken>
hobo down --camp pr-123
```

### Broker targeting and anonymous deploy

Target resolution for `up` / default remote association:

1. `--broker` or `--broker-uri` (aliases)
2. `HOBO_BROKER` or `HOBO_BROKER_URI`
3. Persisted profile under `HOBO_HOME` / `~/.hobo/profile.json`
4. Embedded local broker (zero-config default)

Remote paths **must** fetch a discovery document before place/claim. Anonymous/`--temporary` is **forbidden** unless discovery sets `supportsAnonymous` (or lists `anonymous` in auth methods). Success prints claim token/URL + TTL + primary URL (Cloudflare temporary / Lakebed claim style). Agents use SPIFFE-style SVID principals distinct from human login; DPoP-capable presentation is preferred for remote agent credentials.

Identity remains the identity plane (`login` / SVID / claim); placement remains the broker plane. No new lifecycle verbs.

`verify`, `can-deploy`, `plan`, `inspect`, and `logs` are read-only diagnostics.
They do not mutate infrastructure. `up` always reruns the applicable gate before
mutation, so a stale preflight result cannot authorize a deploy.

Local resilience diagnostics are read-only projections too. The HOBO-520 proof
command under `src/draft/technical-proofs/resilience-semantics-annex` demonstrates the shape that
`hobo dev`, `testRuntime`, or a later `inspect run` surface may render: retry
attempts, policy denial, cancellation cleanup, and deadline escalation are read
from replay-derived persisted facts, and stale in-memory snapshots are not an
authoritative source.

## Retired or Rejected Commands

| Command | Replacement | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `destroy` | `down` | Retired. Teardown is the inverse of `up`. |
| `ship` | `up` | Rejected synonym. Shipping is convergence via `up`; use canonical `deploy` only for attested CD observe (`status`/`logs`/`rollback`). |
| `teardown` | `down` | Retired. Use the same destructive verb everywhere. |
| `rollback` | `up` | Retired as a verb. Use `hobo up --rollback` or `hobo up --to <revision>`. |
| `promote` | `up` | Retired as a verb. Use `hobo up --camp <target> --to <revision>`. |
| `yard` | `up` | Rejected. A Yard is an SDK object/program; bootstrap it with `hobo up ./platform`. |
| `forge` | `build` | Rejected. Build/componentization is `hobo build`. |
| `train` | `up` | Rejected. Training is declared in code and promoted through the same gate. |
| `crew` | `inspect` | Rejected. The Crew is SDK code plus dashboard/MCP surfaces, observed through projections. |
| `fleet` | `inspect` | Rejected. Fleet views are dashboard projections and `hobo inspect` output. |

## Lint Contract

`npm run docs:cli-lint` scans Markdown command examples and `@hobo/cli`
package summaries. Fenced examples may use only canonical first-level `hobo`
verbs, and package summaries may not list retired verbs. This keeps examples
from reintroducing retired lifecycle, Yard, or Forge drift after this hardening
pass.
