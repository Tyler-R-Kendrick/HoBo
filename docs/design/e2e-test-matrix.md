# E2E Test Matrix Scope And Acceptance

Source issue: HOBO-438.

Executable proof lives in
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/e2e-test-matrix-scope-acceptance`](../../src/draft/exp-proofs/e2e-test-matrix-scope-acceptance/README.md).
Branch evidence is summarized in
[`proofs/hobo-438-e2e-test-matrix`](./proofs/hobo-438-e2e-test-matrix/README.md).

## M0 Acceptance Record

The E2E Test Matrix exists to define which launch-readiness journeys, fixtures, boundaries,
evidence records, pass thresholds, fail thresholds, and owner handoffs are required before HoBo
can claim beta, release-candidate, or GA confidence. It is not the full browser E2E harness, a
live-provider execution lane, a device lab, or a release decision.

## User And Business Goal

HoBo needs accepted M0 scope for the E2E Test Matrix before downstream automation, compatibility,
bootstrap, support, security verification, and release cutline work can depend on it. The accepted
record must say who the tests serve, which evidence dimensions every matrix row carries, how gaps
route, which adjacent projects own implementation, and which M1 proof assets must exist before
M2+ harness work fans out.

## Primary Personas

| Persona | Need |
|---|---|
| Release owner | Know which E2E evidence gates beta, release-candidate, and GA decisions and where missing evidence routes. |
| App developer | Understand which launch journeys prove project creation, testing, deployment, inspection, and recovery. |
| Platform engineer | Distinguish mocked, fixture, and live boundaries so matrix rows do not imply unsupported infrastructure claims. |
| Security reviewer | Verify that security, provenance, secretless, and capability-scope evidence is required before launch claims pass. |
| Support operator | Receive failure, flake, quarantine, and handoff evidence without owning test-runner implementation. |

## Scope In

- Define the M0 E2E Test Matrix product scope, accepted personas, and launch-readiness goal.
- Define mandatory matrix dimensions: journey, persona, environment, fixture data, mocked/live
  boundary, expected evidence, pass threshold, fail threshold, owner, and release phase.
- Define service, UX, security, and support boundaries for E2E evidence without building the full
  harness.
- Define M1-ready evidence for journey inventory, fixture boundary map, evidence schema,
  flake/quarantine policy, and release-claim handoff.
- Define follow-up gate rules so M1/M2/M3/M4 implementation and automation issues wait for
  accepted M0 scope.

## Scope Out And Non-Goals

- Do not build a full browser E2E harness.
- Do not run live provider execution, production load tests, or real cloud mutations.
- Do not define a broad browser/device compatibility lab.
- Do not make beta, release-candidate, or GA go/no-go decisions.
- Do not create downstream M1-M4 execution issues before M0 scope is accepted.
- Do not replace the HOBO-500 launch persona matrix thresholds.

## Service, UX, Security, And Support Boundaries

| Boundary | Rule |
|---|---|
| Service | E2E Test Matrix defines evidence rows and ownership; service teams own harness execution, provider fixtures, CI lanes, and persistence. |
| UX | E2E Test Matrix defines user journeys and evidence expectations; product UX teams own screens, flows, copy, and visual test implementation. |
| Security | E2E Test Matrix requires provenance, secretless, capability-scope, and redaction evidence; security projects own scanners, policy engines, and vulnerability handling. |
| Support | E2E Test Matrix defines failure, flake, and quarantine handoff evidence; support workflow owns response targets, escalation, and customer communications. |

## Required Matrix Dimensions

| Dimension | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Journey | The named beta, release-candidate, or GA path under test. |
| Persona | The user or reviewer whose launch confidence depends on the row. |
| Environment | The local, staged, release-candidate, SaaS, or self-host context for the evidence. |
| Fixture data | The deterministic inputs used by the journey. |
| Mocked/live boundary | The explicit split between simulated, fixture-backed, and live dependencies. |
| Expected evidence | The durable artifacts the row must produce. |
| Pass threshold | The condition required for the row to count as accepted evidence. |
| Fail threshold | The condition that blocks launch confidence or routes to follow-up. |
| Owner | The project or role responsible for evidence quality and gap routing. |
| Release phase | Whether the row matters for beta, release-candidate, GA, or post-GA. |

## Authoritative Dependencies

- [developer-experience.md#plan-07](./developer-experience.md#plan-07) defines developer CLI,
  sandbox, local test, dashboard, inspect, and verification surfaces consumed by E2E journeys.
- [architecture.md#plan-10](./architecture.md#plan-10) defines monorepo/package architecture,
  conformance suites, and examples-as-tests conventions.
- [ADR-0082](./adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0082) pins Golden Suites as default-on deployment
  verification with coverage honesty and A2H handoff on failure.
- [launch-e2e-persona-matrix.md](./launch-e2e-persona-matrix.md) defines the downstream
  HOBO-500 persona matrix and launch thresholds that consume this M0 scope boundary.
- [release-notes-upgrade-guide.md](./release-notes-upgrade-guide.md) consumes E2E thresholds and
  compatibility evidence before customer-facing release claims are written.

## Owning Initiative Dependencies

| Owner | Consumes from E2E Test Matrix | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| E2E Test Matrix | Accepted matrix dimensions, M1 evidence checklist, and follow-up gate. | This issue defines scope and acceptance; it does not build the E2E runner. |
| V1 Release Program & Cutline | E2E evidence state for beta, release-candidate, and GA go/no-go records. | Cutline decisions and accepted-risk workflows remain in release program scope. |
| Compatibility Matrix | Journey environment and browser/device coverage gaps for supported surface decisions. | Browser/device/platform compatibility testing remains outside E2E Matrix M0. |
| Performance & Load Tests | Launch journey thresholds and expected-load rows for capacity/load evidence. | Load execution, capacity simulation, and performance envelopes remain with Performance & Load Tests. |
| Bootstrap Installer | Install and first-project smoke requirements as E2E fixture inputs. | Installer implementation and bootstrap smoke execution stay in Bootstrap Installer. |
| Support Workflow | Flake, failure, quarantine, and support-handoff evidence records. | Ticket routing, SLA promises, and customer escalation execution stay in Support Workflow. |
| Security Verification | Required security/provenance/capability evidence for launch-claim review. | Security scanners, vulnerability triage, and policy enforcement stay in Security Verification. |

## Evidence Required For M1

| Evidence | Owner | Proof mode | Proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| Journey inventory | E2E Test Matrix | Design record | Every launch journey names persona, owner, release phase, and readiness intent. |
| Fixture boundary map | Platform engineering | Reference fixture | Every row distinguishes mocked, fixture, and live boundaries without unsupported provider claims. |
| Evidence schema | E2E Test Matrix | Contract test | Matrix evidence records have deterministic fields for expected evidence, pass threshold, and fail threshold. |
| Flake and quarantine policy | Support Workflow | Support handoff | Flakes, repeated failures, and unknown states route to quarantine or owner review instead of silent pass. |
| Release claim handoff | V1 Release Program & Cutline | Release handoff | Release notes, compatibility, and go/no-go records consume only accepted E2E evidence. |

## Gap Routing

| Gap | Owner |
|---|---|
| Browser, device, platform, or compatibility fixture missing | Compatibility Matrix |
| Load, latency, capacity, threshold, or performance evidence missing | Performance & Load Tests |
| Install, bootstrap, first-project, or smoke evidence missing | Bootstrap Installer |
| Security, secretless, provenance, capability, or vulnerability evidence missing | Security Verification |
| Support, flake, quarantine, or handoff evidence missing | Support Workflow |
| Unknown journey owner or uncategorized evidence gap | E2E Test Matrix |

## Follow-Up Gate

M1/M2/M3/M4 journey automation, CI lane, compatibility lab, load test, installer smoke, support,
and security follow-ups must wait until this M0 scope record is accepted. This branch records the
gate and its executable guard; it does not create follow-up implementation issues.
