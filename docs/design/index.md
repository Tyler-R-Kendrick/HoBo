# HoBo — Design Plan Suite

> A suite of inter-related design plans for **HoBo**, a **WIT/WASM** programmable surface (Component Model / wasmCloud) + cloud control plane — TypeScript is the first reference implementation, not a requirement ([ADR-0069](./adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069)).
> This began as a **design-first repository** and is not yet a shipped HoBo product; it now pairs the design suite with a production `packages/` workspace (60+ package manifests, ~160k lines of non-test TypeScript) plus executable draft proof/contract packages under `src/draft/<kind>/<slug>` and validation scripts. Proofs prove design claims before production implementation; honest-scope caveats live in [live-provider-matrix](./live-provider-matrix.md) and the README status summary. The design is a set of capability docs plus contract records; each plan keeps a stable `#plan-NN` anchor so areas can still be cited precisely.

## Index

Each capability doc is one coherent decision area; some absorb more than one plan (the folded plan keeps its `#plan-NN` anchor in the host doc). Contract records pin public surfaces that cross multiple capability docs. Post-core cross-cutting capability deltas get their own discoverable row here, plus a Linear owner, proof README, traceability row, and executable `src/draft/<kind>/<slug>` proof instead of being folded into completed epics.

**Decisions** live in [`adr/`](./adr/index.md) — 4 thematic decision docs plus standalone/split-out ADR files (each decision is a `#adr-NNNN` section). The current ADR/Plan -> Linear coverage gate is [`traceability.md`](./traceability.md). Executable draft proofs and contract packages live under [`../../src/draft/`](../../src/draft/): technical proofs in [`../../src/draft/technical-proofs/`](../../src/draft/technical-proofs/), experience proofs in [`../../src/draft/exp-proofs/`](../../src/draft/exp-proofs/), epic rollups in [`../../src/draft/epic-proofs/`](../../src/draft/epic-proofs/) and registered in [`../../src/draft/epic-proofs/_registry.md`](../../src/draft/epic-proofs/_registry.md), and project MVP rollups in [`../../src/draft/projects/`](../../src/draft/projects/). Registry `Status` is operational metadata: `complete` means the linked rollup PR has merged, while `in_review` is reserved for an open rollup PR.

**Stage gates:** [`build-s1-stage-gate-acceptance.md`](./build-s1-stage-gate-acceptance.md) is the production S1 acceptance record (runtime-port/component-host/sdk-parity conformance, offline `hobo dev`, replay == live); [`proofs/s1-stage-gate/index.md`](./proofs/s1-stage-gate/index.md) is the originating draft-proof record it re-points from. The standing S1 CI lane is `.github/workflows/s1-stage-gate.yml`; the S2 and S3 gates are `.github/workflows/s2-stage-gate.yml` (First Cloud + Yard, evidence in [`stage-2-first-cloud-yard-acceptance.md`](./stage-2-first-cloud-yard-acceptance.md)) and `.github/workflows/s3-stage-gate.yml` (Agent Autonomy, evidence in [`stage-3-agent-autonomy-acceptance.md`](./stage-3-agent-autonomy-acceptance.md)).

**Archived planning material** (not part of the current design state — revived when the work is scoped): the **roadmap / build sequence** and the formal **requirements suite** (BRD/PRD/TRD + BR→FR/NFR→TR traceability) live in [`../archive/`](../archive/); the archived roadmap's stages 0–6 are superseded by the M0–M4 phase model ([ADR-0116](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0116)). The design-relevant scope boundary and NFR/SLO targets are kept in the design itself ([ADR-0063](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0063)/[ADR-0064](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)/[ADR-0021](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0021)).

**Competitor references** live in [`../competitors/`](../competitors/). Displaced-alternative lineage is recorded as ADRs — e.g. the Nomad scheduler pillar ([ADR-0106](./adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0106), parity in [`../competitors/nomad.md`](../competitors/nomad.md#hobo-mapping)).

**Scope.** The suite covers one designed platform surface plus its launch program, with two distinct bounds. (1) **Platform capability surface:** every numbered plan is in scope, bounded by the AI-native-meta-cloud-minus-monetization line ([ADR-0063](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0063)/[ADR-0064](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064)) — HoBo the product ships no billing/monetization capability (no `billing` port, invoicing, tax, rev-share, or subscriptions); build sequencing/phasing of this surface is deferred planning (archived). (2) **Productization & launch records:** the "Productization M0/M1" rows in the index above (for example [`billing-launch-policy.md`](./billing-launch-policy.md), [`usage-metering.md`](./usage-metering.md), [`usage-to-invoice-reconciliation.md`](./usage-to-invoice-reconciliation.md), [`entitlements-plan-limits.md`](./entitlements-plan-limits.md), [`tax-currency-receipt-obligations.md`](./tax-currency-receipt-obligations.md), [`marketplace-payout-hooks.md`](./marketplace-payout-hooks.md)) describe how the hosted HoBo offering itself is launched, billed, and operated as a business — vendor operating records with their own M0/M1 phasing, not platform capabilities, so they do not move the ADR-0064 cut line; their release-readiness evidence phases through the M0-M4 gates recorded in [ADR-0116](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0116).

**Reading order.** New to HoBo: [Vision](./vision.md#plan-00) → [Architecture](./architecture.md#plan-10) → [Worked example](./worked-example.md#plan-19), then the two deep plans [SDK](./sdk-api.md#plan-02) and [AI-native/agent-auth](./ai-native-agent-auth.md#plan-06). Want it by role: the [Walkthrough](./walkthrough.md) takes one app through six clean workflows — app developer, platform engineer, GitOps, SecOps, DevOps, and SRE — each with its own loop and one shared verb (`hobo up`). Runtime/authoring model: [WASM/WASI](./wasm-runtime-wit.md#plan-20) → [Resources/`.allow()`/wiring](./authoring-resources-wiring.md#plan-21) → [AI implementations](./generated-stack.md#plan-23). Evaluating vs alternatives: [Positioning](./vision.md#plan-17) + [`docs/competitors/`](../competitors/). Auditing decisions: the [ADR docs](./adr/index.md).

## Context

**Problem.** Shipping software still forces application developers to become part-time platform engineers: picking clouds, wiring IaC, designing for HA, and operating infra. Tools today force a bad trade — either an opinionated closed PaaS (simple but locked-in, e.g. **Lakebed**) or raw multi-cloud IaC (powerful but heavy). Neither is built for the world that's coming, where **AI agents are the primary builders and deployers**.

**What HoBo is.** An *intermediary cloud control plane* with a developer-centric, cloud-agnostic programmable surface that is **WIT/WASM** (the Component Model / wasmCloud) — **TypeScript is the first reference implementation, not a requirement**; any Component-Model language authors against the same WIT interfaces ([ADR-0069](./adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0069)). Developers describe their app once through **PaaS / SaaS / CaaS / IaaS abstractions**; a **provider pattern** (ports & adapters) maps those abstractions onto real providers. You can map the whole app to a single provider ("just host this on Azure, figure it out"), split tiers across providers, or pin specific boundaries to specific providers — and drop to typed **provider-specific options** when you want to optimize. IaC tools (Pulumi, Crossplane, Terraform/OpenTofu) and image/VM tools (Dagger, Packer, Vagrant, Firecracker) are themselves pluggable via the same ports/adapters pattern.

**Why it wins.** Write cloud-agnostic code that ships anywhere; reach for provider-native power only when you want to. The API *feels like* [Vercel Workflows](https://workflow-sdk.dev/) for its durable `workflow`/`step` ergonomics, but the durable runtime is **HoBo-native and provided per [Camp](#glossary--naming-thematic-all-tunable)** (no dependency on any single vendor's runtime). The whole system is **AI-native**: actor-model + choreography sagas over a replayable event store, agents as first-class authenticated users, a machine-readable **auth/capability standard** so agents self-provision credentials with zero developer effort, and AI-generated provider plugins instead of relying on a community to write them.

**Intended outcome.** A self-hostable (or hosted) **hobo-cloud** orchestrator + an SDK such that a developer (or an agent) can `hobo up` an app and have it land on real infrastructure — agnostic by default, optimizable on demand.

### Competitive frame vs Lakebed (what we deliberately do differently)

Full capture + parity tracker: [`docs/competitors/lakebed`](../competitors/lakebed.md#hobo-mapping).

| Dimension | Lakebed | HoBo |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of deploy | "Capsule" (one full-stack TS app on their runtime) | **Bindle** (app topology mapped to *any* provider mix) |
| Cloud model | Single closed hosted runtime | **Cloud-agnostic** ports/adapters, multi-provider, self-hostable |
| IaC | Hidden, none exposed | Pluggable **IaC providers** (Pulumi/Crossplane/Terraform/OpenTofu) |
| Runtime model | Synchronous RPC (queries/mutations) | **Actors + durable workflows + choreography sagas** over a replayable event store |
| Agents | Agent-readable contracts; basic guest/Google auth | **Agents as first-class authenticated principals**; auto-token issuance via a capability standard; durable AI agents; MCP control surface |
| Extensibility | Community / first-party | **AI-generated provider plugins** gated by conformance tests |

## Glossary & naming (thematic, all tunable)

HoBo's metaphor is the itinerant worker who travels light. Names are proposals; technical meaning is what matters.

The canonical term source is [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md). The canonical event-family source is [`event-families.md`](./event-families.md). Naming note: `hobo:sdk` is the WIT contract/package; `@hobo/sdk` is the operator SDK. The `docs:design-lint` gate fails on duplicate glossary terms, broken internal links or anchors, unindexed ADR references, `hobo:sdk`/`@hobo/sdk` ambiguity, and event families used outside the catalog.

## Technical standards

All implementation-facing design work follows the cross-cutting standards in [`technical-standards.md`](./technical-standards.md): latest stable TypeScript over vanilla JavaScript, Protobuf for data contracts, CUE for invariants/dependent constraints and derivative object definitions, parse-don't-validate at trust boundaries, and PACT-style contract tests for integration edges. These standards reinforce the suite's existing WIT/WASM portability model by catching schema, compatibility, and invariant drift before runtime.

## Keeping docs current

When a draft package, validation script, workflow, or public contract changes, update this design suite or the nearest proof/contract README in the same change. CI runs `pnpm run docs:freshness` so implementation-facing changes cannot merge without a documentation update.
