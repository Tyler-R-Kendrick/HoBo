# Launch Messaging Claims

Source issue: HOBO-406.

Executable proof lives in
[`src/draft/launch-messaging-claim-register`](../../src/draft/launch-messaging-claim-register/README.md).

## M0 Acceptance Record

V1 launch messaging must be evidence-led. A public-facing claim is publishable only when it has an
evidence owner, an evidence source, a risk rating, and a current capability state. This record does
not write final launch copy; it defines the claim register that future launch-site and demo work
must consume before publication.

## M1 Dogfood/Alpha Evidence Gate

Source issue: HOBO-458.

Executable proof lives in
[`src/draft/launch-site-demo-alpha-evidence-contract`](../../src/draft/launch-site-demo-alpha-evidence-contract/README.md).
Branch evidence is summarized in
[`proofs/hobo-458-launch-site-demo-alpha-evidence`](./proofs/hobo-458-launch-site-demo-alpha-evidence/README.md).

The M1 dogfood/alpha gate accepts the launch-site, messaging, and demo-asset evidence map without
building the launch site. The gate records owner-mapped evidence, blockers, accepted risks, release
cutline dependencies, follow-up rules, and parent-initiative status behavior.

### M1 Gate Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Owner-mapped evidence | Claim register, golden-path checklist, recording-manifest slot, cutline documentation domain, and known-limitations register all carry owner project and source. |
| Blockers and risks | Alpha-only recording evidence and reference-fixture demo behavior are recorded as accepted risks with mitigations. |
| Release cutline | Documentation, productization, and operations-readiness dependencies map to the v1 cutline blocker domains. |
| Follow-up creation | Execution follow-ups are allowed only when evidence is explicitly marked missing. |
| Parent initiative | The HoBo v1 Release Readiness initiative needs a status update only when the gate changes launch risk. |
| Public claims | Public claims require accepted live evidence; reference fixtures and alpha-only slots cannot be promoted to production-readiness wording. |

## Claim States

| State | Meaning | Publication rule |
|---|---|---|
| `implemented` | There is branch evidence or an accepted design/proof record for the capability shape. | Candidate wording may be drafted when the evidence source is linked. |
| `simulated-reference` | The claim is backed by reference fixtures, design records, or contract tests rather than live hosted behavior. | Must be labeled as simulated or reference evidence. |
| `beta-only` | The claim depends on dogfood, beta, or private operational evidence. | Public wording waits for accepted beta evidence or stays private-beta only. |
| `future-roadmap` | The capability is planned or designed but not launch-proven. | Keep out of public launch claims unless framed as roadmap and legally reviewed. |

## Initial Claim Register

| Claim | State | Evidence owner | Evidence source | Risk | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HoBo is an AI-native meta-cloud that maps one app description onto provider-owned infrastructure through cloud-agnostic ports. | `implemented` | V1 Release Program & Cutline | [`v1-cutline-contract`](../../src/draft/v1-cutline-contract/README.md) | Medium | Candidate with M1 dogfood/alpha cutline evidence; beta/GA evidence still required before broader operational claims. |
| Launch demos can use accepted example-app proof modes to separate live behavior from reference or simulated evidence. | `simulated-reference` | Example Apps | [example-apps.md#M0 Acceptance Record](./example-apps.md#m0-acceptance-record) | Medium | Candidate with proof-mode label. |
| Dogfood and beta operations evidence can support private-beta messaging before broader GA operational claims are made. | `beta-only` | V1 Dogfood Yard & Hosted Operations | HOBO-403 | High | Follow-up before public use. |
| Customer-facing release notes will distinguish supported install paths, upgrade guidance, known limitations, and support contacts. | `future-roadmap` | V1 Release Notes & Upgrade Guide | [known-limitations-register.md](./known-limitations-register.md) | Medium | Follow-up before launch publication; scope-out claims must pass the known-limitation guard. |
| Built-in operator agents are part of the product story, but launch wording must stay tied to current Crew design and proof evidence. | `future-roadmap` | Operators/SRE | [operators-sre.md#PLAN-40](./operators-sre.md#plan-40) | High | Scope out until proof evidence exists. |

## Required Demo Assets

| Asset | Owner | Proof mode | Refresh trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claim index | Launch messaging owner | Design record | Any public-facing claim changes state, owner, or evidence source. |
| Demo script | Demo maintainer | Manual review | Golden path, persona, or unsupported-state wording changes. |
| Command transcript | Example Apps | Reference fixture | Example app command path, fixture output, or CLI wording changes. |
| Screenshot set | V1 Launch Site, Messaging & Demo Assets | Live recording | UI surface, proof-mode label, or launch visual changes. |
| Recording manifest | V1 Launch Site, Messaging & Demo Assets | Live recording | Demo recording, expected output, or simulated/reference marker changes. |

## Scope Out And Follow-Up

| Item | Reason | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Launch site build | HOBO-406 drafts the claim register; it does not build or publish the launch site. | V1 Launch Site implementation issue. |
| Unproven production-readiness claims | Production-readiness claims need beta, RC, or GA evidence before publication. | Known limitation or go/no-go blocker. |
| Unsupported provider, runtime, billing, support, or operations breadth | Those claims require their owner evidence and must not be inferred from reference fixtures. | Owner project follow-up. |

## Authoritative Dependencies

- [vision.md#plan-17](./vision.md#plan-17) defines competitive positioning and scope honesty.
- [example-apps.md](./example-apps.md) defines proof modes launch demos can consume.
- [developer-experience.md#plan-07](./developer-experience.md#plan-07) owns CLI/demo command surfaces.
- [operators-sre.md#plan-40](./operators-sre.md#plan-40) owns Crew/operator-agent claims.
- [ADR-0064](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0064) keeps monetization and business
  process mechanics outside the platform scope.

## Evidence Required For Publication

| Evidence | Owner | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| Claim register | Launch messaging owner | Every claim has state, owner, source, risk, and disposition. |
| Cutline evidence | V1 Release Program & Cutline | Implemented claims match the accepted v1 support boundary. |
| Proof-mode labels | Example Apps and Demo maintainer | Simulated/reference/beta/live evidence is not overclaimed. |
| Known-limitations register | V1 Release Notes & Upgrade Guide | Unsupported claims move to scope-out or follow-up before publication, and supported-v1 wording for scoped-out items is rejected. |
| Demo asset manifest | V1 Launch Site, Messaging & Demo Assets | Launch demos can be refreshed when claims or proof sources change. |

## Private Beta Evidence Gate

HOBO-465 adds the M2 private beta gate for this project. The executable proof lives in
[`src/draft/launch-site-private-beta-evidence-contract`](../../src/draft/launch-site-private-beta-evidence-contract/README.md),
with branch evidence summarized in
[`proofs/hobo-465-launch-site-private-beta`](./proofs/hobo-465-launch-site-private-beta/README.md).

Private beta launch messaging may consume the claim register and golden-path demo records only when
required evidence has owners, accepted sources, demo asset refresh triggers, blockers, accepted
risks, cross-project dependencies, and release-readiness sync. This gate does not publish final
copy, build the launch site, or promote private beta evidence to public, release-candidate, or GA
claims.

## Follow-Up Gate

Future launch-site, demo, release-note, and public-copy work must consume this register. A claim with
no evidence source, unsupported state, or high-risk publish disposition without follow-up/scope-out
routing is not ready for launch publication.
The customer-facing scope-out register is
[`known-limitations-register.md`](./known-limitations-register.md).
