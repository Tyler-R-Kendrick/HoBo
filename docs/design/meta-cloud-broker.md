# Meta-cloud Broker

Source issue: HOBO-521.

Executable proof:
[`meta-cloud-broker-scope-contract`](../../src/draft/meta-cloud-broker-scope-contract/README.md)

Branch evidence:
[`proof record`](./proofs/hobo-521-meta-cloud-broker/README.md)

This M0 record defines the accepted productization scope for the Meta-cloud Broker. It does not
build broker runtime code, Yard planner behavior, provider adapters, admin UI, Gatekeeper policy
changes, token broker changes, Contract IR changes, or provider Capability Manifest changes.

The Linear issue cites `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-meta-cloud-broker-design.md`; that file
is absent on `origin/main` for this branch. The HOBO-521 issue body, the cited design docs, and this
M0 record are the reviewable source of truth for this branch.

## M0 Acceptance Record

Meta-cloud Broker is accepted for M1 only when this record and the executable draft proof agree on:

- the user/business goal and primary personas;
- scope in, scope out, and non-goals;
- broker, Yard, admin, and Gatekeeper authority boundaries;
- the core artifact vocabulary and minimum M1 proof expectations;
- service, UX, security, and support ownership boundaries;
- M1 proof evidence; and
- the follow-up issue gate.

M1/M2/M3/M4 follow-up issues must wait until the M0 scope record is accepted.

## User And Business Goal

HoBo needs a distinct hosted broker authority before downstream broker work can claim safe
meta-cloud resolution. The business goal is to validate application Contract Manifests against
approved Broker Environments and emit Resolution Receipts or Resolution Rejections that Yard can
consume without silently re-running hosted broker authority locally.

## Primary Personas

| Persona | Need |
|---|---|
| Broker admin | Approves Broker Environments and mapping state without becoming the broker authority. |
| Platform engineer | Publishes provider/catalog/mapping evidence that the broker can validate deterministically later. |
| App developer | Receives clear receipt or rejection evidence for a Contract Manifest without guessing placement rules. |
| Support operator | Explains failed or stale broker resolution using customer-safe receipt and rejection evidence. |
| Security reviewer | Verifies authority, tamper, replay, and policy boundaries before public broker claims ship. |

## Scope In

- Name the user/business goal and primary broker-admin, platform-engineer, app-developer,
  support-operator, and security-reviewer personas.
- Record broker-vs-Yard-vs-admin-vs-Gatekeeper authority boundaries.
- Define the M1 artifact vocabulary: Contract Manifest, Broker Environment, Mapping Contract,
  Broker Catalog Snapshot, Resolution Receipt, and Resolution Rejection.
- Map owning initiative and project dependencies without taking their implementation scope.
- List M1 evidence required before artifact schema, receipt consumption, deterministic resolution,
  admin controls, or adversarial hardening work can fan out.
- Record the follow-up gate that blocks M1/M2/M3/M4 broker work until this M0 scope is accepted.

## Scope Out And Non-Goals

- Do not implement broker runtime code, resolution algorithms, hosted service persistence, signing,
  or live broker execution.
- Do not implement Yard planner, Matching, ResourcePlan, DeploymentPlan, provider adapter, or IaC
  behavior changes.
- Do not implement admin UI, settings pages, approval workflows, or a live operator console.
- Do not replace Gatekeeper, policy engine, token broker, Contract IR, or provider Capability
  Manifest.
- Do not make public or release-facing broker claims without named proof mode and source evidence.
- Do not create or start downstream M1-M4 broker work before this M0 record and executable proof are
  accepted.

## Authority Boundaries

| Boundary | Owner | M0 decision |
|---|---|---|
| Meta-cloud Broker | Meta-cloud Broker | Validates Contract Manifests against approved Broker Environments and emits signed Resolution Receipts or structured Resolution Rejections. |
| Yard control plane | Control Plane: Planner, Matching & Orchestrator | Consumes Resolution Receipts as broker evidence and executes Yard-local planning without silently re-resolving hosted broker authority. |
| UX admin controls | Admin Console | Proposes and approves Broker Environment inputs; cannot mutate an issued receipt after resolution. |
| Gatekeeper | Contracts, Policy & Governance | May block, waive, or require policy obligations, but does not rewrite broker mapping outcomes. |

Yard, admin controls, and Gatekeeper cannot overwrite a broker decision in place. A superseding
decision requires a new Resolution Receipt, a new Resolution Rejection, or an explicit policy
decision with its own evidence.

## Core Artifact Vocabulary

| Artifact | Owner | Minimum M1 proof expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Contract Manifest | App developer / SDK authoring | Schema fixture names requested capabilities, constraints, and declared application contract facts. |
| Broker Environment | Broker admin | Approved environment snapshot fixture lists allowed providers, catalogs, policies, and version pins. |
| Mapping Contract | Platform engineering | Mapping fixture proves provider/catalog choices are constrained inputs, not unilateral selection authority. |
| Broker Catalog Snapshot | Registry / provider catalog | Snapshot fixture pins provider Capability Manifest, conformance, trust tier, and stale-state behavior. |
| Resolution Receipt | Meta-cloud Broker | Receipt fixture names manifest digest, environment digest, decision, signature envelope, and Yard handoff facts. |
| Resolution Rejection | Meta-cloud Broker | Rejection fixture names deterministic reason codes for stale, incompatible, ambiguous, or unsupported mappings. |

## Service, UX, Security, And Support Boundaries

| Boundary | Owner | M0 decision |
|---|---|---|
| Service | Meta-cloud Broker | Owns authority vocabulary, artifact set, evidence list, and follow-up gate; runtime implementation waits for later issues. |
| UX | Admin Console | May later expose environment proposal and approval controls; UI work is out of this M0 issue. |
| Security | Contracts, Policy & Governance | Requires proof that Gatekeeper policy can block or require obligations without rewriting broker receipts. |
| Support | Support Workflow | Receives customer-safe receipt/rejection evidence and escalation ownership without hidden resolution changes. |

## Owning Initiative Dependencies

| Initiative | Dependency |
|---|---|
| Meta-cloud Broker | Owns M0 authority vocabulary, artifact set, evidence list, and follow-up gate. |
| Control Plane: Planner, Matching & Orchestrator | Owns later Yard receipt consumption and no-re-resolve proof; planner implementation remains there. |
| Providers, IaC & Build Adapters | Owns provider Capability Manifests, catalog entries, and mapping publications consumed by broker proofs. |
| Contracts, Policy & Governance | Owns Gatekeeper decisions, policy obligations, and contract compatibility without rewriting receipts. |
| Admin Console | Owns later UX controls for environment proposals and approvals, not this M0 scope record. |
| Support Workflow | Consumes receipt/rejection evidence for customer-safe debugging and escalation. |
| V1 Release Program & Cutline | Uses proof mode and source evidence before public broker claims or GA handoff language. |

## Evidence Required For M1

| Evidence | Mode | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| Artifact schema contract | Schema test | Contract Manifest, Broker Environment, Mapping Contract, catalog snapshot, receipt, and rejection schemas are pinned. |
| Authority boundary fixture | Contract test | Broker, Yard, admin controls, and Gatekeeper cannot silently overwrite each other. |
| Receipt consumption fixture | Integration fixture | Yard consumes Resolution Receipts without re-running hosted broker resolution. |
| Catalog snapshot fixture | Deterministic fixture | Provider/catalog mapping inputs are versioned and stale states are visible. |
| Rejection taxonomy fixture | Negative test | Stale, incompatible, ambiguous, and unsupported mappings fail with structured Resolution Rejections. |
| Scope-boundary register | Policy fixture | Runtime, planner, provider, admin UI, Gatekeeper, and public-claim work route to follow-up owners. |

## Authoritative Dependencies

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) supplies Yard, Registry, Identity, Provider, and Capability
  Manifest context.
- [Control Plane](./control-plane.md) supplies planner, matching, deployment plan, and provider
  capability feedback context.
- [Platform Engineering](./platform-engineering.md) supplies Resource Definition, provider-owned
  defaults, pre-approved catalog, and offline bundle context.
- [Contracts & Policy](./contracts-policy-flags.md) supplies Gatekeeper, contract, policy, waiver,
  and obligation boundaries.
- [Glossary](./glossary.md) supplies the shared vocabulary introduced by this M0 record.

## Follow-Up Gate

Do not create or start M1/M2/M3/M4 Meta-cloud Broker follow-up work until reviewers accept this M0
scope record and its executable proof. Adjacent decisions route to the owning initiatives above:
Yard receipt consumption to Control Plane, provider/catalog publication to Providers/IaC, policy and
waiver behavior to Contracts & Policy, environment proposal UX to Admin Console, and customer-safe
debugging to Support Workflow.
