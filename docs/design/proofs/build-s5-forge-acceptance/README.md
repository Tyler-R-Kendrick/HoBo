# Build S5 Forge Acceptance Proof

This proof README backs the Stage-5 (Forge & Extensibility) M0 acceptance record per the
[post-399 cross-cutting delta pattern](../../../implementation-plan.md).

## Branch Evidence

- Issue: S5-01 ([HOBO-646](https://linear.app/quickdeploy-ai/issue/HOBO-646/s5-01-m0-acceptance-record-productionization-plan-for-stage-s5-forge))
- Source M0 record: [stage-5-forge-extensibility-acceptance.md](../../stage-5-forge-extensibility-acceptance.md)
- Promoted epic proofs:
  - [`generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety`](../../../../src/draft/epic-proofs/generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety/README.md)
  - [`providers-iac-build-adapters`](../../../../src/draft/epic-proofs/providers-iac-build-adapters/README.md)
  - [`portability-registry-distribution`](../../../../src/draft/epic-proofs/portability-registry-distribution/README.md)

## Acceptance Mapping

| Acceptance bullet | Epic proof | Runnable command |
|---|---|---|
| `hobo forge <provider-url>` → certified signed provider in Registry (FR-041) | `generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety` — cold-start scaffold, LLM-fill, no-egress validation, bounded repair, signed certification, registry publication | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety test` |
| Stubbed port → AI implementation reproducing recorded traces, promoted through gate (FR-040) | `generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety` — stub-to-impl promotion with conformance + trace replay | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety test` |
| Gated live-fix with auto-rollback; failing trace retained (FR-042) | `generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety` — live-fix gating, failing-trace retention, human approval for risky changes | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety test` |
| No-egress generation + bounded repair + malicious-provider containment (D2, NFR-007) | `providers-iac-build-adapters` — `generation-certification-sandbox.pact.json` slice | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/providers-iac-build-adapters test` |
| Signed Resource Packs + supply-chain gates (D4, TR-112) | `providers-iac-build-adapters` — signed Resource Pack distribution slice | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/providers-iac-build-adapters test` |
| Install verification: signature, provenance, conformance, catalog, trust; never auto-selected (D4) | `portability-registry-distribution` — certified listing install flow | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/portability-registry-distribution test` |
| Yank fails closed; running-set remediation obligation (D4) | `portability-registry-distribution` — supply-chain response scenario | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/portability-registry-distribution test` |
| Champion/challenger + shadow traffic promotion (D2) | `generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety` — training and eval promotion slice | `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/generation-pipeline-training-ai-safety test` |

## Adversarial Coverage

The cited epic proofs reject unsigned plugins, sandbox egress, repair-budget exhaustion without
`gen.NeedsHuman`, high-trust auto-promotion without human approval, and Registry listings that bypass
signature/provenance/conformance verification. Scope creep into production `packages/*` implementation
is explicitly out of this M0 record.
