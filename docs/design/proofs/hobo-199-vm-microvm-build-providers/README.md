# HOBO-199 VM/microVM BuildProviders Proof

HOBO-199 is proven by the independent draft package:

- package: [`src/draft/vm-microvm-build-providers-contract`](../../../../src/draft/vm-microvm-build-providers-contract/README.md)
- focused gate: `npm.cmd --prefix src/draft/vm-microvm-build-providers-contract test`

## Design Coverage

- [`control-plane.md#plan-04`](../../control-plane.md#plan-04) defines
  `BuildProvider` as the adapter family that turns build specs into ImageRefs
  consumed by provider IacPrograms.
- [`control-plane.md#build--vm-adapters`](../../control-plane.md#build--vm-adapters)
  names Packer, Firecracker, and Vagrant as the VM/microVM adapters.
- [`architecture.md#plan-10`](../../architecture.md#plan-10) reserves the
  `build-packer`, `build-firecracker`, and `build-vagrant` package homes.
- [`adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0005`](../../adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0005)
  requires one ports/adapters shape for build artifacts.
- [`adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042`](../../adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042)
  requires local-dev fidelity claims to stay explicit and honest.

## Acceptance Evidence

- `@hobo/build-packer` returns deterministic VM-image ImageRefs for AWS AMI and
  Azure managed-image fixture targets with pinned Packer toolchain metadata.
- `@hobo/build-firecracker` returns a deterministic microVM rootfs ImageRef with
  required kernel modules and `executorBase: true`.
- `@hobo/build-vagrant` returns a deterministic local VM box ImageRef linked to
  the production VM ImageRef it claims to mirror.
- All ImageRefs are wired into the fixture provider IacProgram and accepted by
  the reference IAC backend.
- The shared conformance gate rejects digest drift, unsupported targets,
  unsupported provider region/arch combinations, Firecracker kernel-module
  omissions, Vagrant local-fidelity drift, and toolchain pin drift.

## Scope Boundary

This POC intentionally does not implement the Executor sandbox runtime,
build-wasm/build-dagger, Workload Profile selection, real Packer/Firecracker/
Vagrant subprocess execution, BuildMachine hosting, or provider-specific
deployment backends.
