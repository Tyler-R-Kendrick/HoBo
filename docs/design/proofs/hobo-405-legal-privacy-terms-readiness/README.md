# HOBO-405 Legal Privacy Terms Readiness Proof

HOBO-405 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/legal-privacy-terms-readiness-contract`](../../../../src/draft/legal-privacy-terms-readiness-contract/README.md)
and the durable scope record at [legal-privacy-terms-readiness.md](../../legal-privacy-terms-readiness.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Checklist covers terms, privacy notice, data retention, telemetry, subprocessors/provider claims,
  security claims, support obligations, and customer communications.
- Each checklist item has an owner, owning project, evidence source, customer-visible message,
  support action, audit evidence, and entitlement impact.
- Open legal/privacy unknowns are classified as launch blockers or explicit post-v1 follow-ups.
- Security, compliance/data-governance, organizational-governance, and meta-cloud scope sources are
  linked.
- Follow-up M1-M4 work is blocked until the M0 checklist is accepted.

## Negative Coverage

- Checklist validation rejects ownerless items.
- Public compliance claims without evidence are rejected.
- Final legal drafting scope creep is rejected.
- Unclassified unknowns are rejected.
