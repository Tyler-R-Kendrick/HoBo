# HOBO-408 Launch Support Escalation Proof

HOBO-408 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/launch-support-escalation-matrix`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/launch-support-escalation-matrix/README.md)
and the durable source record at
[launch-support-escalation.md](../../launch-support-escalation.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Escalation matrix lists severity levels, first responder, escalation owner, expected response,
  customer communication, and handoff criteria.
- Support/debug tooling prerequisites are listed for observability, incident timeline, tenant
  context, status-page redaction, runbook notification, and release/feature context.
- Incident communication templates are drafted with audience, channel, body placeholders, evidence
  source, and redaction gate.
- Known gaps route to support, admin console, operators/SRE, and reliability/observability/cost
  projects.

## Negative Coverage

- Validation rejects unapproved customer-facing SLA promises.
- Validation rejects support-tooling implementation scope creep.
- Validation rejects customer communication templates without redaction and evidence gates.
- Follow-up execution remains blocked until the M0 record is accepted.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\launch-support-escalation-matrix test
```
