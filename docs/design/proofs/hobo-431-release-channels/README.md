# HOBO-431 Release Channels M0 Scope Proof

This proof records the accepted Release Channels M0 scope and acceptance boundary before downstream
M1-M4 work can depend on beta, release-candidate, GA, or patch channel claims.

## Evidence

- Design record: [`docs/design/release-channels.md`](../../release-channels.md)
- Executable POC: [`src/draft/exp-proofs/release-channels-scope`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/release-channels-scope/README.md)
- Issue: HOBO-431

## Acceptance Mapping

| Acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| User/business goal and primary personas are explicit. | `RELEASE_CHANNELS_SCOPE.goal` and `personas` are asserted in `test/release-channels-scope.test.ts`. |
| Scope in/out and non-goals are recorded. | `scopeIn`, `scopeOut`, `nonGoals`, and `validateReleaseChannelsScope` are executable. |
| Owning initiative dependencies and service/UX/security/support boundaries are mapped. | `boundaries`, `designRefs`, `adrRefs`, and `initiativeDependencies` are asserted. |
| Evidence required for M1 design and contract proof is listed. | `requiredEvidence` and `m1Evidence` are asserted. |
| Follow-up M1/M2/M3/M4 issues are created only after M0 acceptance. | `canCreateReleaseChannelsFollowUp` blocks implementation phases until accepted. |

## Scope Boundary

This proof does not implement deployment promotion, artifact publication, compatibility generation,
marketing publication, support ticketing, status-page publication, security attestation, or
legal/privacy signoff workflows.
