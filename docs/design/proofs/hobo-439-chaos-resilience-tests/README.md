# HOBO-439 Chaos & Resilience Tests M0 Scope Proof

HOBO-439 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/chaos-resilience-tests-scope-acceptance`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/chaos-resilience-tests-scope-acceptance/README.md)
and the durable scope record at [chaos-resilience-tests.md](../../chaos-resilience-tests.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Goal and personas are explicit for SRE operators, release owners, platform
  engineers, security leads, and support operators.
- Scope in, scope out, non-goals, and service/UX/security/support boundaries are
  recorded.
- Dependencies map to the chaos pattern, Plan 05, Plan 09, Plan 40, ADR-0047,
  and ADR-0082.
- Owning initiative dependencies map Chaos & Resilience Tests,
  Reliability/FinOps, E2E Test Matrix, Security Verification, release cutline,
  support, and Operators/SRE without taking their implementation scope.
- M1 evidence is listed as scope record, experiment inventory, steady-state
  hypothesis fixture, fault-boundary policy, blast-radius/abort evidence, and
  support/release handoff.
- Follow-up M1-M4 issues are blocked until M0 acceptance is recorded.

## Negative Coverage

- Scope validation rejects live chaos runner, production fault injection,
  provider adapter, Golden Suite, SLO engine, SRE remediation, dashboard,
  support workflow, credential mutation, destructive-test, or policy-bypass
  implementation creep.
- Request classification routes adjacent implementation work to owning projects
  instead of expanding HOBO-439.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\chaos-resilience-tests-scope-acceptance test
```
