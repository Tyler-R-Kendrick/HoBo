# HOBO-440 Performance & Load Tests M0 Scope Proof

HOBO-440 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/performance-load-tests-scope-contract`](../../../../src/draft/performance-load-tests-scope-contract/README.md)
and the durable scope record at [performance-load-tests.md](../../performance-load-tests.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Goal and personas are explicit for release owners, platform engineers, SRE operators, FinOps
  reviewers, and support operators.
- Scope in, scope out, non-goals, and service/UX/security/support boundaries are recorded.
- Dependencies map to Plan 05, the E2E Test Matrix, the launch persona matrix, the pre-launch
  outcome contract, ADR-0045, and ADR-0082.
- Owning initiative dependencies map Performance & Load Tests, E2E Test Matrix, release cutline,
  reliability/FinOps, support, and security without taking their implementation scope.
- M1 evidence is listed as scenario inventory, workload model fixture, capacity envelope schema,
  threshold/abort policy, and evidence retention/support handoff.
- Follow-up M1-M4 issues are blocked until M0 acceptance is recorded.

## Negative Coverage

- Scope validation rejects load-runner, stress-test, benchmark-lab, live-provider, production-load,
  autoscaling, chaos-experiment, or launch-decision implementation creep.
- Follow-up gating refuses M1-M4 issue creation while M0 is not accepted.
- Evidence-gap classification routes known gaps to owning productization projects instead of
  treating missing evidence as a silent pass.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\performance-load-tests-scope-contract test
```
