# HOBO-448 Support Workflow Proof

This proof backs the M0 productization record for
[Support Workflow](../../support-workflow.md).

## Branch Evidence

- Issue: HOBO-448
- Draft package:
  [`src/draft/exp-proofs/support-workflow-scope-contract`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/support-workflow-scope-contract/README.md)
- Focused gate:
  `npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\support-workflow-scope-contract test`

## Acceptance Mapping

| Issue acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| User/business goal and primary personas are explicit. | `SUPPORT_WORKFLOW_SCOPE.goal` and `personas` are asserted by package tests. |
| Scope in/out and non-goals are recorded. | Scope arrays and non-goals are documented and validated. |
| Initiative dependencies and service/UX/security/support boundaries are mapped. | Boundary and initiative dependency records are asserted. |
| Evidence required for M1 design and contract proof is listed. | Six M1 evidence records are asserted by the test suite. |
| Follow-up M1/M2/M3/M4 issues wait for M0 acceptance. | `canCreateSupportWorkflowFollowUp` blocks implementation phases until `m0Accepted` is true. |

## Adversarial Coverage

The executable proof rejects productization creep into helpdesk automation, production
customer-data access, unapproved response-time or SLA promises, and incident-command ownership.
It also routes adjacent work to Support Tooling, Incident Communications, Admin Console, Business
Owner / Legal, Security Verification, or Support Workflow so later implementation cannot silently
inherit another initiative's authority.
