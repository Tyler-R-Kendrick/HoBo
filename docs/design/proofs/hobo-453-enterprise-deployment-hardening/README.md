# HOBO-453 Enterprise Deployment Hardening Proof

This proof backs the M0 productization record for
[Enterprise Deployment Hardening](../../enterprise-deployment-hardening.md).

## Branch Evidence

- Issue: HOBO-453
- Draft package:
  [`src/draft/enterprise-deployment-hardening-scope-contract`](../../../../src/draft/enterprise-deployment-hardening-scope-contract/README.md)
- Focused gate:
  `pnpm.cmd --prefix src\draft\enterprise-deployment-hardening-scope-contract test`

## Acceptance Mapping

| Issue acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| User/business goal and primary personas are explicit. | `ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT_HARDENING_SCOPE.goal` and `personas` are asserted by package tests. |
| Deployment postures are named before enterprise implementation work fans out. | `deploymentPostures` covers managed SaaS, self-hosted Yard, sovereign or air-gapped, and local-dev simulation. |
| Scope in/out and non-goals are recorded. | Scope arrays and non-goals are documented and validated. |
| Authoritative dependencies and service/UX/security/support boundaries are mapped. | Dependency and boundary records are documented in the design record and carried in the executable scope. |
| Evidence required for M1 design and contract proof is listed. | Seven M1 evidence records are asserted by the test suite. |
| Follow-up M1/M2/M3/M4 issues are created only after M0 acceptance. | `canStartEnterpriseHardeningFollowUp` blocks implementation phases until `m0Accepted` is true. |

## Adversarial Coverage

The executable proof rejects scope creep into production deployment runtime,
identity and tenant-control implementation, backup/restore/upgrade execution,
commercial/legal/support commitments, and customer-facing enterprise readiness
claims that lack proof source and owner route.
