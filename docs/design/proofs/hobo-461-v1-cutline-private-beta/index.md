# HOBO-461 V1 Cutline Private Beta Proof

HOBO-461 is proven by the focused M2 contract at
[`src/draft/v1-cutline-contract`](../../../../src/draft/v1-cutline-contract/README.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- The required M2 evidence IDs cover the accepted cutline baseline, private-beta go/no-go record,
  blocker delta, accepted-risk register, and cross-project handoff.
- Each evidence item maps to an owning project and source record.
- Blockers, accepted risks, release-note/support/legal/dogfood/beta-pilot dependencies, and missing
  owner evidence are recorded in the cutline proof.
- Follow-up issues are allowed only for missing evidence; this proof points operations evidence to
  HOBO-462, beta pilot feedback to HOBO-463, and legal/privacy evidence to HOBO-464 rather than
  creating duplicate work.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required when this gate changes launch risk.

## Negative Coverage

- Pending evidence cannot pass the M2 gate.
- Duplicate follow-ups against accepted evidence are rejected.
- A launch-risk change without parent status sync is rejected.
- Private-beta release-program evidence is not promoted to release-candidate or GA proof.
