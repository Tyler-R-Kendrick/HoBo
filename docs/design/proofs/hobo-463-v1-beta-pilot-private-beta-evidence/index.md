# HOBO-463 V1 Beta Pilot Private Beta Evidence Proof

HOBO-463 is proven by the focused M2 evidence-gate contract at
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/v1-beta-pilot-private-beta-evidence`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/v1-beta-pilot-private-beta-evidence/README.md)
and the durable scope record at [beta-pilot-feedback.md](../../beta-pilot-feedback.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Required M2 private-beta evidence is listed and mapped to owning projects.
- Blockers and accepted risks are recorded as first-class release evidence.
- Cross-project dependencies are reflected in the release cutline.
- Follow-up issue specs are generated only for missing evidence.
- Parent release-readiness status changes only when the evidence changes launch risk.

## Negative Coverage

- Scope validation rejects beta customer onboarding.
- Scope validation rejects support ticketing/tooling implementation.
- Scope validation rejects resolving launch blockers inside this proof package.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\v1-beta-pilot-private-beta-evidence test
