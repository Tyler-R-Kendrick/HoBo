# HOBO-465 Launch Site Private Beta Evidence Proof

HOBO-465 is proven by the focused M2 contract at
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/launch-site-private-beta-evidence-contract`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/launch-site-private-beta-evidence-contract/README.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Required evidence covers the launch claim register, golden-path demo record, launch asset
  manifest, private-beta cutline dependency, and legal/privacy handoff.
- Each evidence item maps to an owning project and evidence source.
- Blockers and accepted risks are recorded for public/GA claim promotion, live recording freshness,
  reference-fixture demo risk, and legal-copy drift.
- Cross-project dependencies cover release cutline, Example Apps, legal/privacy readiness, and
  launch support handoff.
- Follow-up issues are allowed only for missing public-copy approval or GA live-recording evidence.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required when this gate changes launch risk.

## Negative Coverage

- Pending required evidence fails the gate.
- Demo assets without owner project, proof mode, source evidence, or refresh trigger fail.
- Private beta evidence cannot promote public or GA launch claims.
- Speculative follow-ups against accepted evidence fail.
- Unsynced launch-risk changes fail.

## Verification

npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\launch-site-private-beta-evidence-contract test
