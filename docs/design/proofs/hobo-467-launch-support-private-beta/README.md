# HOBO-467 Launch Support Private Beta Evidence

HOBO-467 is proven by the focused M2 contract at
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/launch-support-private-beta-evidence-contract`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/launch-support-private-beta-evidence-contract/README.md).

## Evidence Summary

- Required private beta support evidence is mapped to Launch Support, Support Workflow, Support SLA,
  Incident Communications, Security Verification, and V1 Release Program owners.
- Blockers and accepted risks are explicit: private beta keeps support language limited, redaction
  gates customer-visible updates, and GA response commitments remain later work.
- Cross-project dependencies feed the release cutline, release notes, incident communications, and
  security verification instead of silently changing launch posture.
- Follow-up records point only to missing M3/M4 evidence: HOBO-474 release-candidate support drill
  and HOBO-481 GA support handoff.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required when support evidence changes launch risk.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\launch-support-private-beta-evidence-contract test
```

The package also carries protobuf, CUE, and PACT boundary artifacts under its `architecture/`
directory for architecture-guard coverage.
