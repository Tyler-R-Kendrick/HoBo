# HOBO-468 V1 Cutline Release Candidate Proof

HOBO-468 is proven by the focused M3 contract at
[`src/draft/v1-cutline-contract`](../../../../src/draft/v1-cutline-contract/README.md)
and the release decision source record at
[`go-no-go-decision-record.md`](../../go-no-go-decision-record.md#m3-release-candidate-evidence-gate).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Required M3 evidence covers the accepted cutline baseline, release-candidate go/no-go record,
  blocker delta, accepted-risk register, cross-project handoff, and release-notes readiness.
- Evidence maps to owning projects and source records before it can pass the M3 gate.
- Blockers and accepted risks record owner, source evidence, disposition, mitigation, launch note or
  follow-up, revisit date, and launch-risk posture.
- Cross-project dependencies keep release notes, support, legal/privacy, dogfood operations,
  launch-site messaging, and beta-pilot inputs reflected in the release cutline.
- Follow-up issues are allowed only for missing evidence; this proof points GA handoff evidence to
  the existing HOBO-475 M4 issue.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required when launch risk changes.

## Negative Coverage

- Pending release-candidate evidence cannot pass the gate.
- Duplicate follow-ups against accepted evidence are rejected.
- A launch-risk change without parent initiative sync is rejected.
- Release-candidate evidence cannot publish GA readiness claims.
