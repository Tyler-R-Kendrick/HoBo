# HOBO-473 Release Notes Release Candidate Evidence

HOBO-473 is proven by the focused M3 contract at
[`src/draft/v1-release-notes-upgrade-guide-release-candidate-evidence-contract`](../../../../src/draft/v1-release-notes-upgrade-guide-release-candidate-evidence-contract/README.md).

## Evidence Summary

- Required release-candidate release-note evidence is mapped to Release Notes, V1 Release Program
  & Cutline, Bootstrap Installer, Upgrade & Migration Engine, Compatibility Matrix, Launch Support,
  and Dogfood/Hosted Operations owners.
- Blockers and accepted risks are explicit: GA release-note handoff remains blocked on HOBO-480,
  and M3 draft evidence does not become final customer copy.
- Cross-project dependencies feed the release cutline across documentation, release-cutline,
  operations-readiness, support, and compatibility domains.
- Follow-up records point only to missing GA release-note handoff evidence.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required for the M3 gate while public GA release-note claims
  remain blocked until M4 evidence exists.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --prefix src\draft\v1-release-notes-upgrade-guide-release-candidate-evidence-contract test
```

The package also carries protobuf, CUE, and PACT boundary artifacts under its `architecture/`
directory for architecture-guard coverage.
