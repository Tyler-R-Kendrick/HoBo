# HOBO-474 Launch Support Release Candidate Evidence

HOBO-474 is proven by the focused M3 contract at
[`src/draft/launch-support-release-candidate-evidence-contract`](../../../../src/draft/launch-support-release-candidate-evidence-contract/README.md).

## Evidence Summary

- Required release-candidate support evidence is mapped to Launch Support, Operators/SRE, Public
  Status Page & Incident Communication, Security Verification, V1 Release Notes, and V1 Release
  Program owners.
- Blockers and accepted risks are explicit: GA support commitments remain blocked on HOBO-481, and
  M3 drills remain manual support evidence rather than production support tooling.
- Cross-project dependencies feed the release cutline across support, operations-readiness,
  documentation, security, and release-cutline domains.
- Follow-up records point only to missing GA support handoff evidence.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required for the M3 gate while public GA support claims remain
  blocked until M4 evidence exists.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --prefix src\draft\launch-support-release-candidate-evidence-contract test
```

The package also carries protobuf, CUE, and PACT boundary artifacts under its `architecture/`
directory for architecture-guard coverage.
