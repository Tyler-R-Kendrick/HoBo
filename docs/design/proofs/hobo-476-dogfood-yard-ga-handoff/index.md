# HOBO-476 Dogfood Yard GA Handoff Proof

This proof summarizes the executable M4 GA handoff contract in
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/dogfood-yard-ga-handoff-evidence-contract`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/dogfood-yard-ga-handoff-evidence-contract/README.md)
and the durable source record at [dogfood-yard.md](../../dogfood-yard.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Required M4 evidence is mapped to Dogfood Yard, Reliability, Bootstrap,
  Support, Release Notes, Meta-cloud Broker, and Release Program owners.
- Blockers and accepted risks keep in-review predecessor gates and the existing
  HOBO-475 release-program GA handoff explicit.
- Cross-project dependencies use release-cutline blocker categories for
  operations-readiness, release-cutline, support, documentation, reliability,
  bootstrap, and broker domains.
- Follow-up execution is limited to missing release-program GA evidence already
  tracked by HOBO-475.
- Parent HoBo v1 Release Readiness sync is required when this handoff reduces
  launch risk.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\dogfood-yard-ga-handoff-evidence-contract test
```

## Scope Guard

The proof does not build Yard runtime, hosted operations runtime, admin UI,
bootstrap installer, support tooling, status-page publication, release
automation, provider operations, or customer-data handling. It rejects public GA
readiness, production recovery, SLA, and live hosted-operations claims that lack
accepted owner evidence.
