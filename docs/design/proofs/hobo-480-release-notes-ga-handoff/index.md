# HOBO-480 Release Notes GA Handoff Evidence

HOBO-480 is proven by the focused M4 contract at
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/v1-release-notes-upgrade-guide-ga-handoff-evidence-contract`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/v1-release-notes-upgrade-guide-ga-handoff-evidence-contract/README.md)
and the durable M4 gate record in
[`release-notes-upgrade-guide.md`](../../release-notes-upgrade-guide.md#m4-ga-handoff-evidence).

## Evidence Summary

- Required GA release-note and upgrade-guide evidence is mapped to Release Notes, Release Program,
  Bootstrap Installer, Compatibility Matrix, Upgrade & Migration Engine, Launch Support, and Docs
  Portal owners.
- Blockers and accepted risks are explicit: the HOBO-473 GA handoff gap is cleared for
  release-owner review, while docs publication and customer communication mechanics remain
  owner-run launch operations.
- Cross-project dependencies feed the release cutline across documentation, release-cutline,
  operations-readiness, support, compatibility, and migration domains.
- No follow-up issues are created because this M4 gate records no missing evidence; speculative
  follow-ups against accepted evidence are rejected.
- Parent release-readiness sync is required because the gate reduces launch risk.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --prefix src\draft\v1-release-notes-upgrade-guide-ga-handoff-evidence-contract test
```

The package also carries protobuf, CUE, and PACT boundary artifacts under its `architecture/`
directory for architecture-guard coverage.
