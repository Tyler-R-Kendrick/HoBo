# HOBO-482 V1 Readiness Dashboard Proof

This proof records the M0 V1 readiness dashboard contract.

## Evidence

- Source record: [`v1-readiness-dashboard.md`](../../v1-readiness-dashboard.md).
- Executable proof: [`v1-readiness-dashboard-contract`](../../../../src/draft/v1-readiness-dashboard-contract/README.md).
- Related cutline contract: [`v1-cutline-contract`](../../../../src/draft/v1-cutline-contract/README.md).

## Acceptance Coverage

| Acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| Dashboard fields cover cutline, blockers, milestone health, evidence links, accepted risks, owners, and last verified date. | `test/v1-readiness-dashboard.test.ts` asserts the exact required field set. |
| Each field has a source of truth and update cadence. | Field records include `sourceOfTruth`, `updateCadence`, and `ownerProject`; tests assert they are present. |
| Missing evidence states are explicit and cannot appear as green. | The validator rejects an `evidenceLinks` empty state with `color: "green"`. |
| Dashboard scope excludes feature implementation and only aggregates release evidence. | The `scope` record is `release-evidence-aggregate`, sets `implementsFeatureWork: false`, and lists feature implementation plus runtime dashboard UI as scope-out. |
