# HOBO-497 Public Status Page Incident Communication Proof

HOBO-497 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/public-status-page-incident-communication-contract`](../../../../src/draft/public-status-page-incident-communication-contract/README.md)
and the durable source record at
[public-status-page-incident-communication.md](../../public-status-page-incident-communication.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Status-page scope covers public components, active incidents, planned
  maintenance, history, and subscription handoff expectations.
- Component taxonomy, incident states, maintenance notice states, update cadence,
  and customer templates are explicit.
- Internal and external-candidate incident triggers remain separated by a
  publication gate.
- Unsupported public status dimensions are documented.
- Support SLA ownership, reliability/SLO evidence, and launch support escalation
  links are present.

## Negative Coverage

- Validation rejects live status-page publishing scope creep.
- Validation rejects unapproved customer-facing SLA promises.
- Validation rejects customer-specific data leakage.
- Follow-up implementation issues remain blocked until the M0 record is
  accepted.

## Verification

npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\public-status-page-incident-communication-contract test
