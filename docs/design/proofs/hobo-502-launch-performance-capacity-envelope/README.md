# HOBO-502 Launch Performance Capacity Envelope Proof

This proof package pins the launch performance, cost, and capacity envelope for M0 scope acceptance.

## Proven Acceptance

- Target workflows, expected beta load, latency/cost thresholds, capacity assumptions, fixture
  shape, and non-goals are present in a deterministic contract fixture.
- Every threshold has a measurable beta and GA target plus support routing and release-note
  disposition for missed targets.
- Cost guardrails are owned by Usage Metering, Billing & Credits, and Entitlements & Plan Limits.
- Fixture rows are synthetic/replayable and explicitly refuse production execution.
- Scope guards reject production load execution and hidden billing/entitlement implementation work.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\launch-performance-capacity-envelope-contract test
```
