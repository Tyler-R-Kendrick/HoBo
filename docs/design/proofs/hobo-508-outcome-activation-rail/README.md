# HOBO-508 V1 Outcome Activation Rail Proof

HOBO-508 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/v1-outcome-activation-rail-contract`](../../../../src/draft/v1-outcome-activation-rail-contract/README.md)
and the durable design record at [outcome-activation-rail.md](../../outcome-activation-rail.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Activation stages name entry criteria, exit criteria, persona labels, evidence objects, and
  handoff projects.
- Required proof surfaces are mapped to existing onboarding, plan/diff, topology/status, safe-test,
  cost/approval, telemetry, support, and docs capabilities.
- Non-expert buyer/user visibility is separated from technical operator visibility.
- The scope boundary classifies the rail as a UX orchestration layer over existing capabilities.
- Follow-up M1-M4 work is blocked until M0 acceptance is recorded.

## Negative Coverage

- Validation rejects missing proof surfaces so the rail cannot hide fragmented evidence.
- Validation rejects duplicate product-shell scope creep.
- Validation rejects stages without evidence objects.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\v1-outcome-activation-rail-contract test
