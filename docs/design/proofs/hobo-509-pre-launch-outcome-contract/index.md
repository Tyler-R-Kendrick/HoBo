# HOBO-509 Pre-Launch Outcome Contract Proof

HOBO-509 is proven by the focused M0 contract at
[`src/draft/pre-launch-outcome-contract`](../../../../src/draft/pre-launch-outcome-contract/README.md)
and the durable scope record at
[`pre-launch-outcome-contract.md`](../../pre-launch-outcome-contract.md).

## Acceptance Evidence

- Minimal outcome fields cover intended business outcome, success signal, owner, cost cap, approval
  rule, failure rule, rollback expectation, and review date.
- Plan/diff, launch go/no-go, telemetry, beta feedback, support handoff, and release notes all map
  to the same baseline field set.
- Safe-test fixtures, safe-test results, plan/diff baseline, post-launch comparison window, and
  support review export are named as evidence requirements.
- Privacy, retention, customer visibility, and redaction boundaries are recorded.
- QUI-92, the competitive persona synthesis, and the persona document are preserved as source
  evidence without implementing the full value loop.

## Negative Coverage

- Governed launches fail closed when owner, cost, access, or control confirmation is missing.
- Live provider success claims require provider-backed evidence.
- Scope validation rejects analytics warehouse, automated ROI, or customer-success lifecycle creep.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\pre-launch-outcome-contract test
