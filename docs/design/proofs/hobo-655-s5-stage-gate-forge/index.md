# HOBO-655 S5 Stage Gate Forge Proof

Executable Stage-5 gate drill as an independent epic rollup:

[`src/draft/epic-proofs/s5-stage-gate-forge-extensibility`](../../../../src/draft/epic-proofs/s5-stage-gate-forge-extensibility/README.md)

## Branch Evidence

- Issue: HOBO-655 (S5-10 STAGE GATE S5)
- Focused gate: `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/s5-stage-gate-forge-extensibility test` (9/9)
- Simulation: `pnpm --prefix src/draft/epic-proofs/s5-stage-gate-forge-extensibility run simulate`

## Acceptance Mapping

| Issue acceptance | Executable proof |
|---|---|
| `hobo forge <url>` yields certified provider with per-interface conformance and `gen.PluginCertified` + provenance in Registry | `hobo forge url yields certified provider with gen.PluginCertified and install verification` |
| Forged provider deploys a Bindle resource end-to-end (J5 journey) | `forged provider deploys a Bindle resource end-to-end` |
| Stubbed port AI implementation reproduces traces and promotes through eval gate | `stubbed port AI implementation reproduces traces and promotes through eval gate` |
| Simulated SLO live-fix auto-rolls back and retains regression test | `simulated SLO regression auto-rolls back and retains regression test` |
| Adversarial: tampered/unsigned refused; high-risk live-fix gated | `adversarial cases refuse tampered or unsigned artifacts and block high-risk live-fix` |

## Scope Boundaries

Draft POC only. Does not implement production `packages/forge`, CLI binary, or merge-dependent S5-05/S5-09 packages. Registry certification events use the cataloged `gen.PluginCertified` family only.
