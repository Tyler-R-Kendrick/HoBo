# HOBO-554 Vibe Accessibility Usability Checklist Proof

This proof records branch evidence for the checklist every downstream vibe
artifact must apply before it can be treated as launch-useful evidence.

## Evidence

- Source baseline: [`accessibility-usability-launch-baseline.md`](../../accessibility-usability-launch-baseline.md).
- Quickstart source: [`resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples`](../resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples/README.md).
- Executable proof: [`vibe-accessibility-usability-checklist`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/vibe-accessibility-usability-checklist/README.md).

## Acceptance Coverage

| Acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| Checklist covers keyboard, focus order, semantic structure, contrast, responsive layout, reduced motion, screen-reader smoke, state clarity, and copy clarity. | `test/vibe-accessibility-usability-checklist.test.ts` asserts the ten required check ids and evidence modes. |
| Matrix maps every vibe surface to required checks, evidence mode, owner, launch severity, and accepted-risk route. | `surfaceChecklist` covers workspace/onboarding, plan/diff, deployment dashboard, marketplace, publisher portal, docs, admin/support, and release/support artifacts. |
| Accessibility checklist evidence consumes accepted HOBO-577 quickstart fixture ids/proof-mode labels. | `quickstartFixtureRefs` pins `rlq-define-object-graph-v1`, `rlq-collect-manifest-ir-v1`, `rlq-plan-safe-preview-v1`, `rlq-deploy-run-accepted-v1`, `rlq-inspect-event-projection-v1`, `rlq-manage-stale-evidence-v1`, `rlq-recover-snapshot-restore-v1`, and `rlq-recover-scope-out-v1`. |
| Package and proof path match the issue. | `parseVibeAccessibilityChecklist` rejects path drift from the target package and proof path. |
| Happy path, blocked path, stale/unknown evidence path, support handoff, accessibility notes, and proof-mode labels are covered. | `scenarios` records all six required scenario paths with required evidence and safe outcomes. |
| Proof labels preserve HOBO-577 distinction between live, simulated, reference fixture, and scope-out. | `REQUIRED_PROOF_MODE_LABELS` and `REQUIRED_ACCESSIBILITY_QUICKSTART_PROOF_MODES` checks require every surface and fixture-ref set to carry the accepted labels. |

## Adversarial Evidence

The parser and tests reject requests that try to turn this proof into product UI
remediation, full audit/certification, broad automated accessibility suite
work, launch waiver approval, customer-data evidence, or launch claims without
named evidence.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd run test:file src/draft/exp-proofs/vibe-accessibility-usability-checklist/test/vibe-accessibility-usability-checklist.test.ts
```
