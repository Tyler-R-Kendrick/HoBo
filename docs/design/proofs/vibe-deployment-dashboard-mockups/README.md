# HOBO-544 Vibe Deployment Dashboard Mockups Proof

This proof records branch evidence for the deployment timeline, topology graph,
run inspector, project/environment fleet, and health/cost/incident rollup
mockup slice.

## Evidence

- Source record: [`deployment-dashboard-topology-explorer.md`](../../deployment-dashboard-topology-explorer.md).
- DX parity source: [`developer-experience.md#plan-07`](../../developer-experience.md#plan-07).
- Quickstart source: [`resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples`](../resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples/README.md).
- Executable proof: [`vibe-deployment-dashboard-mockups`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/vibe-deployment-dashboard-mockups/README.md).

## Acceptance Coverage

| Acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| Mockups cover platform operator, application developer, release owner, support engineer, and security reviewer questions. | `test/vibe-deployment-dashboard-mockups.test.ts` asserts every required persona has a wireframe with a concrete operating question. |
| Fixtures show projection source, freshness, owner, tenant/RBAC disposition, safe next action, and proof mode per field group. | `fieldGroups` carry those fields for deployment timeline, topology graph, run inspector, project/environment fleet, and health/cost/incident rollups. |
| Package and proof path match the issue. | `parseVibeDeploymentDashboardMockups` rejects path drift from the target package and proof path. |
| Happy path, blocked path, stale/unknown evidence path, support handoff, accessibility notes, and proof modes are covered. | `scenarioPaths`, `accessibilityNotes`, and proof-mode validation cover each acceptance state and label. |
| Dashboard fixtures consume or cite accepted HOBO-577 quickstart fixture ids/proof-mode labels. | `quickstartFixtureRefs` pins `rlq-deploy-run-accepted-v1`, `rlq-inspect-event-projection-v1`, `rlq-manage-stale-evidence-v1`, `rlq-recover-snapshot-restore-v1`, and `rlq-recover-scope-out-v1` with `reference-fixture`, `simulated`, `live`, and `scope-out` labels. |

## Adversarial Evidence

The parser and tests reject requests that try to turn this proof into production
dashboard UI, a visual graph renderer, projection/read-store/GraphQL runtime,
live provider traversal, tenant/RBAC implementation, or launch readiness claims
without evidence.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\vibe-deployment-dashboard-mockups test
```
