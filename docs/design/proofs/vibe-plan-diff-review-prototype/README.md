# HOBO-560 Vibe Plan/Diff Review Prototype Proof

This proof records branch evidence for a deterministic plan/diff review prototype
that composes accepted M1 plan review states and annotation pseudocode.

## Evidence

- Plan review state source: [`vibe-plan-review-states`](../vibe-plan-review-states/README.md).
- Annotation pseudocode source: [`vibe-plan-annotation-pseudocode`](../vibe-plan-annotation-pseudocode/README.md).
- Quickstart fixture source: [`resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples`](../resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples/README.md).
- Source record: [`plan-diff-viewer.md`](../../plan-diff-viewer.md).
- Executable proof: [`vibe-plan-diff-review-prototype`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/vibe-plan-diff-review-prototype/README.md).

## Acceptance Coverage

| Acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| Prototype consumes M1 plan review states and annotation pseudocode artifacts. | Tests assert accepted HOBO-542 and HOBO-543 dependencies through parsed proof exports and composed `annotationRefs`. |
| Golden fixtures cover create, update, no-op, destructive, blocked, stale, and unknown evidence plans. | `goldenFixtures` is parsed against the required state list. |
| Package and proof path match the issue. | Parser rejects target package or proof path drift. |
| Happy path, blocked path, stale/unknown evidence path, support handoff, accessibility notes, and proof-mode labels are covered. | Scenario tests require every state and proof mode to be represented. |

## Adversarial Evidence

The classifier rejects planner/matcher implementation, apply/rollback runtime,
approval service work, live cost API usage, production plan/diff UI, and
launch-readiness claims.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm.cmd --dir src\draft\exp-proofs\vibe-plan-diff-review-prototype test
