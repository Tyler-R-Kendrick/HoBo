# HOBO-542 Vibe Plan Review States Proof

This proof records branch evidence for plan review mockups covering safe,
blocked, destructive, stale, and unknown evidence states.

## Evidence

- Source record: [`plan-diff-viewer.md`](../../plan-diff-viewer.md).
- DX parity source: [`developer-experience.md#plan-07`](../../developer-experience.md#plan-07).
- Quickstart source: [`resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples`](../resource-lifecycle-quickstart-examples/README.md).
- Executable proof: [`vibe-plan-review-states`](../../../../src/draft/exp-proofs/vibe-plan-review-states/README.md).

## Acceptance Coverage

| Acceptance | Proof |
|---|---|
| Mockups distinguish create, update, no-op, destructive, blocked, stale, and unknown evidence states. | `test/vibe-plan-review-states.test.ts` asserts the exact accepted state sequence and parser rejection for missing states. |
| Fixtures include owner, safe next action, evidence source, risk category, policy disposition, and customer-safe wording. | `planStates` carries these fields plus cost/capacity dispositions and proof mode. |
| Package and proof path match the issue. | `parseVibePlanReviewStates` rejects path drift from the target package and proof path. |
| Happy path, blocked path, stale/unknown evidence path, support handoff, accessibility notes, and proof modes are covered. | `scenarioPaths`, `supportHandoff`, `accessibilityNotes`, and proof-mode validation cover each acceptance state and label. |
| Plan/Diff consumes or cites accepted HOBO-577 quickstart fixture ids/proof-mode labels. | `quickstartFixtureRefs` pins `rlq-plan-safe-preview-v1`, `rlq-manage-stale-evidence-v1`, `rlq-migrate-brownfield-preview-v1`, and `rlq-recover-snapshot-restore-v1` with Plan/Diff usage notes. |

## Adversarial Evidence

The parser and tests reject requests that try to turn this proof into planner or
matcher implementation, apply/rollback runtime, live cost API/provider
credential usage, production UI/approval workflow, or launch readiness claims
without evidence.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\exp-proofs\vibe-plan-review-states test
