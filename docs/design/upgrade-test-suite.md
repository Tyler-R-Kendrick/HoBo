# Upgrade Test Suite Scope And Acceptance

Source issue: HOBO-433.

Executable proof lives in
[`src/draft/exp-proofs/upgrade-test-suite-scope-contract`](../../src/draft/exp-proofs/upgrade-test-suite-scope-contract/README.md).
Branch evidence is summarized in
[`proofs/hobo-433-upgrade-test-suite`](./proofs/hobo-433-upgrade-test-suite/README.md).

## M0 Acceptance Record

Upgrade Test Suite exists to define the launch-critical upgrade evidence contract before follow-up
test harness, fixture, compatibility, release, support, or security work depends on it. The record
names upgrade scenario classes, required evidence fields, result states, owners, and scope guards.
It is not a production upgrade test runner, migration engine, rollback executor, compatibility UI,
release approval workflow, support automation, or live customer-data test program.

## User And Business Goal

HoBo needs accepted M0 scope for Upgrade Test Suite so release owners, platform engineers, DevOps
operators, support operators, and security reviewers know which upgrade evidence must exist before
beta, release-candidate, or GA upgrade claims are made. The accepted record supports launch planning
without executing migrations, restores, rollbacks, provider-state changes, or customer
notifications.

## Primary Personas

| Persona | Need |
|---|---|
| Release owner | Needs beta, release-candidate, and GA upgrade evidence without turning this scope record into a launch approval. |
| Platform engineer | Needs deterministic upgrade scenarios, fixtures, compatibility inputs, and pass/fail states before harness work begins. |
| DevOps operator | Needs self-host and local/dev upgrade expectations, rollback prerequisites, and recovery evidence before attempting upgrades. |
| Support operator | Needs blocked-upgrade reasons, troubleshooting handoff fields, and customer-safe limitation language. |
| Security reviewer | Needs backup, data-handling, secret-handling, and waiver evidence before any upgrade path becomes customer-facing. |

## Scope In

- Define upgrade scenario classes for hosted control plane, self-host Yard, local/dev runtime,
  SDK/package, and data-shape changes.
- Record required evidence fields for source version, target version, deployment mode,
  compatibility matrix reference, preflight, backup/restore proof, migration plan, rollback proof,
  security review, and support handoff.
- Define result states for passed, blocked, unsupported, needs-manual-review, waived-with-risk, and
  failed upgrade suite outcomes.
- Map service, UX, security, and support boundaries for upgrade test suite evidence and downstream
  handoffs.
- List owning initiative dependencies across Upgrade & Migration Engine, Compatibility Matrix,
  Backup & Restore, Bootstrap Installer, Release Notes, Security Verification, and Support
  Workflow.
- List M1 evidence required before a test harness, fixture corpus, dry-run report, compatibility
  result schema, or support troubleshooting map can depend on this record.

## Scope Out And Non-Goals

- Do not build a production upgrade test runner, scheduler, CI service, hosted rollout controller,
  or execution orchestrator.
- Do not execute live schema migrations, customer data rewrites, provider/IaC state mutations, or
  projection rebuilds.
- Do not execute live backup restore, rollback operation, disaster recovery runner, or tenant
  restore behavior.
- Do not build a compatibility dashboard, upgrade wizard, release UI, browser grid, or device lab.
- Do not publish final release notes, approve launch risks, resolve launch blockers, or make a
  go/no-go decision.
- Do not build support ticket automation, helpdesk integration, customer notification workflow, or
  SLA commitment.
- Do not collect real secrets, scan customer environments, persist credentials, or use live tenant
  data.
- Do not create downstream M1-M4 design or implementation issues before M0 scope is accepted.

Non-goals:

- Replace Upgrade & Migration Engine dry-run contract or build live migration behavior.
- Replace Compatibility Matrix browser, device, platform, package, or runtime support decisions.
- Replace Backup & Restore rollback drills or prove production recovery readiness.
- Publish final release notes, approve launch risks, or create support automation.
- Execute live migration, rollback, restore, provider-state, or customer-data operations.

## Service, UX, Security, And Support Boundaries

| Boundary | Rule |
|---|---|
| Service | Upgrade Test Suite M0 owns scenario taxonomy, required evidence, result states, and M1 suite proof expectations; execution services remain later work. |
| UX | UX scope is future customer-safe labels, limitations, and troubleshooting evidence for release notes, compatibility, and support surfaces, not dashboards or wizards. |
| Security | Security scope names backup, data-handling, secret-handling, waiver, and audit evidence without touching credentials or live customer data. |
| Support | Support receives blocked-path reasons, escalation owner, troubleshooting handoff, and rollback guidance without adding support tooling. |

## Upgrade Scenario Classes

| Scenario | Evidence shape | Out of scope |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted control plane | Hosted control-plane version transition using release gate, tenant-impact classification, rollback posture, and support handoff evidence. | Hosted rollout controller, canary execution, live tenant migration, billing, or RBAC changes. |
| Self-host Yard | Operator-owned Yard upgrade path with source/target versions, offline constraints, backup prerequisite, and recovery notes. | Installer changes, backup restore, disaster recovery runner, or live environment mutation. |
| Local/dev runtime | Local CLI/runtime upgrade fixture with component-host pin, unsupported toolchain routing, and no production parity claim. | CLI implementation, local updater, real project migration, or developer machine scan. |
| SDK/package | SDK/package compatibility window with WIT/API posture, deprecation note, and consumer proof expectation. | Package publishing, generated SDK rewrites, or registry release automation. |
| Data-shape | Schema or data-shape transition with migration dry-run facts, snapshot requirement, and rollback evidence requirement. | Live schema migration, data rewrite, projection rebuild, cross-cloud move, or provider state mutation. |

## Required Evidence Fields

| Field | Owner | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| Source version | Upgrade & Migration Engine | Names the starting HoBo version, package, manifest, WIT, or schema version under test. |
| Target version | Upgrade & Migration Engine | Names the destination version and whether it is beta, release-candidate, or GA. |
| Deployment mode | Bootstrap Installer | Classifies SaaS, self-host, local/dev, SDK/package, or data-shape path before support claims. |
| Compatibility matrix reference | Compatibility Matrix | Links browser, device, platform, component-host, provider, package, or runtime compatibility evidence. |
| Preflight result | Upgrade Test Suite | Records deterministic pass, blocked, unsupported, manual-review, waived, or failed preflight result. |
| Backup/restore proof | Backup & Restore | Names backup prerequisite, restore drill, unsupported restore state, or accepted limitation. |
| Migration plan | Upgrade & Migration Engine | Links dry-run plan summary, blocked reasons, and non-mutating migration facts. |
| Rollback proof | Backup & Restore | Names rollback evidence before any path is described as recoverable. |
| Security review state | Security Verification | Records waiver, blocker, customer-data, secret-handling, and fix-verification posture. |
| Support handoff | Support Workflow | Names customer-safe troubleshooting owner, escalation path, limitation, and next action. |

## Result States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Passed | All required evidence exists for the declared path without unaccepted launch risk. |
| Blocked | A required compatibility, backup, security, release, or support gate is missing or failed. |
| Unsupported | The path is explicitly outside v1 support and must route to release notes or limitations. |
| Needs manual review | A human owner must evaluate evidence before release or support can present the result. |
| Waived with risk | A release owner accepted a bounded risk with owner, expiry, mitigation, and customer-safe note. |
| Failed | The suite found a regression or incompatible path that cannot be represented as supportable. |

## Owning Initiative Dependencies

| Owner | Consumes from Upgrade Test Suite | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Upgrade Test Suite | Scenario taxonomy, evidence fields, result states, suite proof expectations, and follow-up gate. | This issue defines scope and acceptance; it does not build runners, migrations, restores, UIs, release approval, or support automation. |
| Upgrade & Migration Engine | Upgrade classes, dry-run facts, migration plan summaries, blocked reasons, and non-mutating upgrade posture. | Live runners, migrations, provider state mutation, and execution logic stay outside this M0 record. |
| Compatibility Matrix | Supported surface and environment evidence. | Matrix engine, UI, browser grid, and platform lab remain separate. |
| Backup & Restore | Backup, restore, rollback, and recovery drill evidence. | Live restore and rollback execution remain separate. |
| Bootstrap Installer | SaaS, self-host, and local/dev bootstrap smoke input. | Installer, first deploy, and recovery implementation remain separate. |
| V1 Release Notes & Upgrade Guide | Accepted upgrade support language after evidence exists. | Final copy, launch claims, and release approval remain separate. |
| Security Verification | Customer-data, secret-handling, waiver, fix-verification, and blocker evidence. | Production access and legal/security approvals stay outside this M0 record. |
| Support Workflow | Blocked-path reasons, troubleshooting handoffs, rollback guidance, and limitations. | Support queues, SLAs, ticket automation, and customer notifications remain separate. |

## Evidence Required For M1

| Evidence | Owner | Source | Proof mode | Proves |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upgrade scenario matrix | Release owner | Scenario classes | Design record | Hosted, self-host, local/dev, SDK/package, and data-shape upgrade paths have accepted coverage rows. |
| Fixture corpus | Platform engineer | Evidence checklist | Reference fixture | Deterministic tenant, project, manifest, package, and data-shape fixtures exist without live customer data. |
| Preflight contract | Platform engineer | Result states | Contract test | Preflight result states are stable and fail closed when evidence is missing. |
| Migration dry-run report | Upgrade & Migration Engine | Required evidence fields | Contract test | Dry-run output includes compatibility, backup, migration plan, blocked reason, rollback, and support facts. |
| Rollback drill fixture | DevOps operator | Rollback evidence field | Recovery fixture | Rollback evidence is required before release or support describes a path as recoverable. |
| Compatibility result schema | Compatibility Matrix | Compatibility evidence field | Schema | Compatibility results carry source/target/version/platform/provider support evidence and unsupported routing. |
| Support troubleshooting map | Support operator | Support handoff field | Support handoff | Support can route blocked, unsupported, manual-review, waived, or failed outcomes with owner and next action. |

## Follow-Up Gate

M1/M2/M3/M4 design or implementation issues must wait until this M0 scope record is accepted. This
branch records the gate and its executable guard; it does not create follow-up implementation
issues.
