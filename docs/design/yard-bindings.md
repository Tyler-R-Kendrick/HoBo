# Yard bindings, phases & the developer loop

How the Yard becomes the capability→product binding authority ([ADR-0157](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0157)), how one program runs in plan/init/handle phases ([ADR-0158](./adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0158)), and how the OOB test harness, CI preview lanes, and default engines ([ADR-0159](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0159)/[ADR-0160](./adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0160)/[ADR-0161](./adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0161)) close the developer-loop bar set by the [Alchemy capture](../competitors/alchemy.md).

This doc is the narrative home for a coordinated design tranche: the [Alchemy competitor capture](../competitors/alchemy.md) surfaced a shipped articulation of ideas HoBo had distributed across several planes without a single authoring surface. The response is **integration, not imitation** — each borrowed idea lands on existing HoBo machinery (ADR-0151 profiles/bindings, yard-first-placement, ADR-0141 membrane, ADR-0042 fidelity, ADR-0032 migrations, ADR-0038 auth) and keeps HoBo's governance where Alchemy has none.

## 1. The problem, precisely

The [yard-first-placement ADR](./adr/yard-first-placement.md) makes the Yard the provider-selection point, and [Plan 4](./control-plane.md#plan-04) resolves providers by context-matching *under the selected Yard* — the Yard is, by design, **responsible for mapping capabilities to cloud provider offerings**. But that responsibility had no authoring surface: `yard()` carried `provider`, regions, residency, and resolver-slot defaults, while the actual mapping lived in provider default Resource Definitions, Camp `resourceMappings`, platform overrides, and the [ADR-0151](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0151) selection pipeline. Connectivity implementations were documented as Yard-scoped ("only applies inside its own Yard") without the Yard type saying so.

Alchemy's Binding model named the seam: a binding declaration is a **capability contract** ("it names the capability and says nothing about how it's satisfied"); a host-specific implementation decides **how** it's satisfied; deploy-time wiring records permissions + configuration + the typed client; an unsatisfiable binding is an authoring-time error.

## 2. Three bindings, one system

HoBo now has three binding-adjacent nouns, deliberately distinct and now jointly coherent:

| Noun | What it is | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **Yard binding** | A row in the Yard's **allocatable catalog** — the fact that this Yard *can* satisfy a capability with this offering, **configured this way**: `{profile → product and/or connectivity, + provider-native realization parameters}`. A capability commonly has several rows; declaring one allocates nothing | [ADR-0157](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0157), `yard()` / `defineYard()` authoring |
| **Capability binding** | The portable connection record a *product* emits for consumers (endpoints as non-secret refs, credential `secretRef`s) | [ADR-0151](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0151), `@hobo/bindings` |
| **Binding membrane** | The only delivery path: WIT import → link → provider export → generated `ctx.bindings.*` | [ADR-0141](./adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0141) |

The pipeline: a Bindle's `.allow()` names the **contract** (what, least-privilege) → the **Yard binding** rows constrain which product/connectivity may satisfy it (how, per Yard) → ADR-0151 selection runs its hard gates + lexicographic ranking under those constraints (`binding.Resolved`) → the product's **Capability binding** is projected through the chosen connectivity implementation into the workload (`binding.Projected`, deploy-time wiring only) → the **membrane** delivers the derived typed client at `ctx.bindings.<alias>` at `init`. Failure anywhere is fail-closed at plan phase (`binding.Unavailable`, composing with the existing `NO_COMPATIBLE_BINDING`/`BINDING_UNAVAILABLE` codes) — HoBo's polyglot answer to Alchemy's "this Layer only works on Workers" type error.

**A Yard is a catalog, not an inventory.** Rows say what this Yard *is able to* allocate — they are not a selection, a mapping, a pool, or a record of anything running. So several rows per capability is the normal case, not an ambiguity to resolve at authoring time: on Azure, `web` legitimately lists Static Web Apps, App Service, Container Apps and AKS, and selection picks among them per resource. Adding a fifth option is a catalog edit, not a deployment change.

Three further rules keep the rows honest, each a correction applied during design review:

- **Rows are a set, not a preference order.** An ordered list would smuggle preference into ranking, which ADR-0151 decision 11 forbids; rows are canonicalized by sort, and duplicate `(profile, productId, connectivityId)` triples are rejected.
- **Provider coherence is resolution-time, not parse-time.** Inferring a product's provider from its id prefix would make a naming convention load-bearing — precisely the external-spec dependency ADR-0144 forbids. Parse checks grammar, shape, credential-shaped properties, and pin/row conflicts; the catalog check happens where the catalog exists.
- **Unmatched rows fail closed with distinguishable reasons** — `YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`, `YARD_BINDING_PROVIDER_MISMATCH`, `YARD_BINDING_EXCLUDED_ALL`. A silently-ignored row would be a portability lie.

Relationship to the pre-existing `resolverDefaults.pins`: pins stay the **resolver-slot** degenerate case (the `event-store` slot); rows are the **capability-profile** plane. The same subject bound by both is a parse-time conflict — a named boundary, not an unnamed mechanism #10.

## 3. The two authoring flows

**Ops manager, day one (`hobo station init`).** Creating a Station seeds a **localhost Yard** (`yard:local`) generated from the host substrate that [ADR-0155](./adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0155) capability discovery already inspects: provider `local`, runtime-local component host, and default-provenance Yard binding rows mapping the whole Bindle catalog to local implementations — each row carrying its [ADR-0042](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0042) fidelity label. This promotes the `@hobo/code` `yard:local` precedent into the platform. The seeded Yard is real (`yard.Registered`, PortabilityReport-scored) and dev-grade *by policy*, not special-casing.

**Ops manager, deliberately (SDK).** Authoring a Yard manually is the same act the seed performs: declare a provider and map capabilities to that provider's products —

```ts
yard("prod-east", {
  provider: "aws",
  regions: ["us-east-1"],
  bindings: [
    // Selection: which offering realizes the profile here.
    { profile: "data.postgres/v1", productId: "aws.rds-postgres/v1",
      // Configuration: how it is realized here (provider-native, scored as
      // non-portable surface — never passed through silently).
      properties: { instanceClass: "db.r6g.large", multiAz: true } },
    { profile: "web.hosted/v1", productId: "aws.eks-deployment/v1",
      properties: { replicas: 2, serviceType: "LoadBalancer",
        resources: { limits: { cpu: "250m", memory: "128Mi" } } } },
    { profile: "binding.postgresql/v1", connectivityId: "oci.service-binding-files/v1" },
  ],
})
```

One surface, two provenances (`default` vs `declared`) — first-run and production authoring are the same language.

**Both halves matter, and the split is deliberate.** Alchemy's EKS example maps a workload onto a `Kubernetes.Deployment` *with* its image, replicas, ports and resource limits; a row that could only name the product would push that configuration somewhere else and leave the Yard's stated responsibility half-discharged. So a row carries selection **and** parameters — but the realization *shape* (which provider resources exist, the compiler and executor) stays in the versioned, catalog-hashed **Resource Definition**, and only its *parameters* live on the row. A Yard therefore parameterizes a definition instead of forking a second configuration system (ADR-0145's "no unnamed mechanism #10"), and because those parameters are provider-native by construction they are scored into the **PortabilityReport** with the specific responsible rows named — which is what keeps "unedited Bindle on N clouds" honest. Rows are a set, so two rows disagreeing on one parameter is refused at plan time (`YARD_BINDING_PARAMETER_CONFLICT`) rather than settled by iteration order.

## 4. Phases

[ADR-0158](./adr/01-architecture-core.md#adr-0158) names the axis run-to-collect already implied: **`plan`** (collect + resolve, no unoffered effects) / **`init`** (per **activation**: `ctx.bindings` clients built exactly once, deterministic given projections) / **`handle`** (per request/event, request-scoped context). `hobo dev` is a plan+init loop with a separate dev flag — dev is a mode, not a phase. Phase safety is the split WIT init/handler interfaces: compile-time in typed guests, conformance-time everywhere.

## 5. The developer loop bars

[ADR-0159](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0159) closes the reserved GAP-026 hook with the `@hobo/testing` harness — one call, three lanes (in-process whole-graph on runtime-local; ephemeral-Camp deploy→assert→destroy where stages are Camps `test`/`pr-<n>`; provider scratch harness shared with the generation pipeline's validate step) — plus credentials-as-code CI preview lanes (broker-minted scoped tokens/OIDC, PR-open→deploy/PR-close→destroy, policy-plane prod guard).

The harness's honesty rule is load-bearing: `runtime-local` does not execute real `.wasm` bytes today, so the in-process lane boots the collected graph with local binding resolution and simulated resources, and **every handle carries an ADR-0042 fidelity attestation** (`real | simulated | mocked | camp-only`). A suite resting on `mocked` handles reports a coverage split, never a bare green tick — anything else would re-commit the overclaim GAP-026 exists to prevent. The ephemeral-Camp lane requires an explicit Yard plus credentials and **fails closed** rather than degrading into the in-process lane. Local-dev inner-loop latency and dashboard depth stay owned by [Plan 7](./developer-experience.md#plan-07)/ADR-0109; estate state stays the event-sourced control plane (ADR-0135) — Alchemy's remote state store (DO+SQLite, encrypted, CI-friendly) is noted in the capture as the bar for a hosted state backend, already satisfied structurally by pluggable `EventStore` adapters gated by conformance.

## 6. Default Yards and the direct-HTTP resolver plane

The Yard vocabulary above is authored through one import per cloud. `@hobo/cloud-providers` exposes a namespace per provider, each with a `Yard()` returning that provider's full allocatable catalog, alongside the typed slot factories the catalog is built from:

```ts
import { aws, azure, cloudflare } from "@hobo/cloud-providers";
import { defineStation } from "@hobo/yards";

export default defineStation("acme", {
  yards: [aws.Yard(), azure.Yard(), cloudflare.Yard({ regions: ["weur"] })],
});
```

The package exists because of a layering fact rather than a design preference: a provider package is a layer-2 adapter and may import `@hobo/core` and nothing else HoBo, while `yard()` lives at layer 3. Providers therefore publish catalogs as *data* (`awsYardSpec()`), and this layer-3 package parses it. It **decides nothing** — `composeYard` hands rows to `yard()` untouched, so canonical ordering, duplicate rejection, and credential screening stay `@hobo/yards` refusals with `@hobo/yards` codes. Filtering rows here would create a second, unversioned selection point, which is the decision [ADR-0157](./adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0157) reserves for resolution time.

Catalog depth follows what each provider actually offers: AWS declares five `web` offerings (App Runner, ECS, EKS, Amplify, and S3+CloudFront on the narrower `web.static/v1`), Azure four, GCP three, Vercel one — the last being an accurate catalog rather than an abridged one, because Vercel ships one product per capability.

**Deployment is direct HTTPS to the provider API, not an engine.** Matching Alchemy's engine-less posture, a `ResourceResolver` (`@hobo/core`) talks to the provider's published REST API over a guarded `HttpTransport`: allowlisted hosts and path prefixes, no redirect chasing, bounded body and time, and a policy breach **refuses rather than clamps** — a silently downgraded timeout is a lie about the guarantee. Credentials are locators (`scheme://path`), never material; a raw token in a `ResolveRequest` is a token in the event log, so it is refused at the parse boundary in both directions.

Convergence is the property that makes removing the engine safe. Every `reconcile()` is read-or-create: it asks the provider whether the deterministically-named resource exists *before* creating anything, then applies only mutable deltas. Running it twice yields one resource and the same `physicalId`, so a crashed half-apply is safe to re-run rather than something an operator reconciles by hand; `delete()` treats "already gone" as success. Destructive `replace` is never emitted — drift on an immutable field is a diagnostic left for a human.

**Relationship to the existing app-layer clients.** `packages/hobo` already carries real Cloudflare and Vercel deploy clients, and they are *not* superseded yet: they implement the `IacProvider` port (`preview`/`apply`/`destroy`/`refresh` over an `IacProgram`) that the `@hobo/cloud` Executor drives, and `hobo up` still routes through them. The resolver plane is the per-product replacement for that engine hop, and today it stands beside the engine path rather than behind `hobo up`. Wiring the Executor onto resolvers is deliberately not part of this tranche.

**HONEST SCOPE.** Cloudflare and Vercel ship resolvers; AWS, Azure, and GCP are catalog-only. Resolvers are proven against an *injected fake transport* with real request and response shapes — no live deploy is proven anywhere in this repo, which additionally needs real credentials and network egress. The AWS, Azure and GCP product ids those factories emit are not registered in the definition catalog, so a deploy against those Yards **fails closed** at resolution (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`) rather than half-applying. Vercel's `edge-function` and `blob` products are in the catalog but deliberately have no resolver: neither exposes a documented list-by-name, so `reconcile` could not discover an existing resource and would duplicate on every retry — a non-convergent resolver is worse than none, and the gap is asserted by test rather than left implicit.

## 7. OOB defaults

[ADR-0160](./adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0160): `drizzle-kit` becomes the default relational schema-diff engine behind the migration port — deploy-owned generation at plan phase (reviewable `migration.Planned` + content-addressed SQL), apply unchanged (ADR-0032 expand→backfill→contract, forward-only), Drizzle schema modules accepted as authoring input via a thin parse-don't-validate adapter. [ADR-0161](./adr/02-identity-security.md#adr-0161): Better Auth becomes the default *self-hosted full-featured* `hobo:auth` adapter, packaged as an auth bundle over existing ports — relational store via `hobo:data/relational` + gated migrations, signing secret brokered (never state-persisted), routes mounted on `api()`/`web()`, host-portable through the membrane rather than per-platform layers.

## 8. What this deliberately does not change

Selection algebra (ADR-0151 hard gates + lexicographic, no weighted scores); Bindle provider-agnosticism (`bindle-provider-selection-forbidden`); the ADR-0131 two-axis Station/topology model (the Station *seeds* `yard:local`, it does not contain it); the no-Effect-TS public surface (ADR-0136); the fidelity-honesty rules (ADR-0042); forward-only migrations (ADR-0032); the federate+verify auth model (ADR-0038).
