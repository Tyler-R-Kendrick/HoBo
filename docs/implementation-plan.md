# HoBo Implementation Plan — Linear backlog mirror

> **Purpose.** This document is the master, branch-sized implementation backlog for the whole
> HoBo platform — the structural mirror of the Linear workspace (team **HoBo**, key `HOBO`). It
> records the full subsystem decomposition: 15 epics and **399** independently-deliverable slices,
> phased M0→M4, with dependency intent. **All slices are now created in Linear** (see *Status*);
> Linear is the authoritative live index, and this doc is the durable plan-of-record.
>
> Every slice is intended to be **independently implementable and provable on its own branch**,
> with full context (why / refs / scope-in / scope-out / acceptance / adversarial / depends-on)
> recorded in the corresponding Linear issue. Where an issue exists, its `HOBO-N` id is given.

## Status (2026-06-24) — COMPLETE

- **Created in Linear:** **399 issues** across all **15 projects** (`HOBO-1` … `HOBO-399`,
  non-contiguous ids), team **HoBo**. Every project is populated; no orphaned/project-less issues.
- **The "cap" was a false alarm.** The `Usage limit exceeded — free issue limit` error was a
  **transient burst rate-limit** triggered by 13 subagents writing to Linear simultaneously — *not*
  a hard workspace cap. Under **paced, single-writer creation** (one `save_issue` at a time, with
  retry-on-throttle), every remaining slice was created with **zero failures**. No plan upgrade was
  needed.
- **Label spread:** 325 `slice`, 109 `security`, 48 `adversarial`, 36 `hardening`, 22 `spike`,
  13 `user-story`, 2 `epic`.
- **All 6 walkthrough role journeys** are filed as `user-story` issues (App dev, Platform eng,
  GitOps, SecOps, SRE, DevOps×2) plus the end-to-end IfC author-flow story.
- **Per-project final tallies:** Providers 34 · Data Plane 32 · Contracts/Policy 32 · Networking 32 ·
  Reliability 31 · Identity 31 · Control Plane 28 · CLI/MCP/DX 28 · WIT Runtime 25 · Harness 24 ·
  Generation 24 · SDK 23 · Portability 22 · Operators/SRE 22 · Foundations 11.

> **Note on markers below.** The per-project sections were authored when ~110 issues existed and the
> rest were still designed-but-uncreated. **Every `▢` slice listed below has since been created in
> Linear.** Linear (team HoBo) is now the authoritative, live index — exact `HOBO-N` ids, current
> status, and the full Why/Refs/Scope/Acceptance/Adversarial/Depends-on bodies live there. This
> document remains the durable *structural* plan: the subsystem decomposition, phasing, and
> dependency intent.

## Post-399 Cross-Cutting Capability Deltas

The original 399-issue mirror remains the baseline for the 15 planned subsystems. New
cross-cutting capabilities discovered after that baseline must not reopen completed epics as
mutable catch-alls. A post-core delta gets its own Linear project and issue family, beginning with
an M0 acceptance record that names scope, authority boundaries, owning lanes, evidence, and blocked
follow-up work.

Minimum durable records for a post-core delta:

- own Linear project or clearly owned Linear issue family;
- M0 acceptance record in `docs/design/` with scope in/out and proof expectations;
- design index row that makes the record discoverable;
- proof README under `docs/design/proofs/` plus executable proof under `src/draft/`;
- traceability row that links issue, design record, and proof; and
- blocked M1-M4 skeleton issues that remain non-actionable until M0 acceptance is Done.

Meta-cloud Broker is the first accepted example of this pattern: HOBO-521 owns the M0 scope record
and proof, and HOBO-524 owns this documentation-pattern hardening.

### Intent-alignment gap review — root [`GAPS.md`](../GAPS.md)

The five-pillar intent review (Nomad × Aspire × Nitric × FinOps × agent-native) keeps a
long-running register at the repo root. Iteration 0 seeds the scaffold (pillar map, method
appendix, empty registers); confirmed findings and remediations append in later commits. Linear
delivery issues for remediations are filed when an iteration confirms them — not in the seed PR.

### HoBo v1 Production Build — staged, pending Linear import

The 399-issue baseline above was executed as **draft proofs** (`src/draft/`); no production code
exists. The production build is scoped as a new Linear **initiative** ("HoBo v1 Production Build"):
seven stage-ordered projects (S0 Toolchain & Contracts Bootstrap → S1 Local SDK & Runtime → S2 First
Cloud + Yard → S3 Agent Autonomy → S4 Multi-Cloud → S5 Forge & Extensibility → S6 Production
Hardening), each closing with an executable gate issue keyed to the requirements Release Criteria,
with later stages opened by M0 acceptance-record issues (the post-core-delta pattern applied to the
build). 79 issues with dependency wiring, plus the companion **Intent-Alignment Gap Remediation**
project (one issue per confirmed [`GAPS.md`](../GAPS.md) remediation), are staged in
[`docs/plans/production-build-backlog.md`](plans/production-build-backlog.md) together with an
import runbook — Linear import runs paced single-writer once MCP access is approved. The 15
completed proof projects stay closed; draft material is promotion source only.

### HoBo v1 Production Build — initiative `bc463c40-f5a8-4246-8d71-0d4dd2f6c6c7` — **Active**

The production-build initiative promotes the proven design suite + draft proofs into real
implementation (runnable `packages/*`, real CLI, real control plane), stage-ordered by the
requirements Release criteria (S0/S1 local → S2 first cloud → S3 agent autonomy → S4 multi-cloud →
S5 Forge → S6 hardening). Created 2026-07-01: **7 stage projects, 27 milestones, 87 issues
(HOBO-578…HOBO-665)**, all labeled `production-build`, dependencies wired as blocking relations.
The 15 completed proof projects stay closed; `src/draft/` is promotion source only. Durable mirror:
[`docs/plans/production-build-backlog.md`](plans/production-build-backlog.md) (see its Import
record for the full identifier map). S0/S1 slices and every stage-M0 acceptance issue carry full
QA-verified one-shot bodies; S2–S6 skeletons are blocked by their stage M0 per the post-core delta
pattern above.

Companion project **Intent-Alignment Gap Remediation** (`292efb1a-669c-4d79-93df-901d134b4832`,
same initiative): 25 issues (HOBO-666…HOBO-690), one per confirmed finding of the gap-review
iteration 1 recorded in [`GAPS.md`](../GAPS.md) (17 gaps + 8 drifts; REM-001…REM-025), labeled
`intent-alignment`, milestoned by remediation class (ADR & scope records · design-doc amendments ·
competitor & standards research · hygiene & traceability). Each issue's executable spec is its
GAPS.md REM entry; all changes are documentation-level.

### Meta-cloud Broker - `3b77f153-55ea-46e1-b1d5-2683901576ba` - **Backlog**

The Meta-cloud Broker project owns the hosted broker authority boundary: Contract Manifest
validation against Broker Environment snapshots, Mapping Contracts from HoBo-native services to
cloud/IaC configurations, Resolution Receipts, Resolution Rejections, and Yard receipt handoff.
Its durable M0 proof remains
[`meta-cloud-broker-scope-contract`](../src/draft/exp-proofs/meta-cloud-broker-scope-contract/README.md).

- HOBO-521 - M0: Define Meta-cloud Broker scope and acceptance - M0 - hardening - 3.
- HOBO-522 - M1: Define broker artifact schemas and validation contract - M1 - slice/hardening - 3.
- HOBO-523 - M1: Prove Yard consumes Resolution Receipts without re-resolving broker authority - M1 - slice/adversarial - 3.
- HOBO-524 - M1: Update docs pattern for post-core cross-cutting capabilities - M1 - hardening - 2.
- HOBO-525 - M2: Implement deterministic meta-cloud broker resolution contract proof - M2 - slice - 5.
- HOBO-526 - M2: Prove provider/catalog mapping publication into Broker Environment snapshots - M2 - slice - 5.
- HOBO-527 - M2: Add admin controls for broker environment proposals and approvals - M2 - slice/security - 5.
- HOBO-528 - M3: Adversarial broker rejection matrix for stale, incompatible, and ambiguous mappings - M3 - adversarial/hardening - 5.
- HOBO-529 - M3: Adversarial receipt integrity and replay/tamper refusal - M3 - adversarial/security - 5.
- HOBO-530 - M4: Prove hosted broker GA handoff evidence - M4 - slice - 3.

All M1-M4 issues are blocked by HOBO-521 until the M0 acceptance record is accepted. The completed
Contracts, Policy & Governance, Control Plane, and Providers/IaC projects have status updates
pointing to this delta while preserving their completed scope.

## Coverage / completeness notes

- **All 15 subsystems are fully materialised** in Linear — **399 issues**, phased M0 Contracts →
  M1 Skeleton → M2 Core → M3 Hardening → M4 GA, with dependency (`blockedBy`) graphs wired within
  and across projects.
- Every subsystem carries **spike** slices for the genuinely uncertain decisions (e.g. wRPC/WIT
  baseline, Matching tie-break, self-host bootstrap ordering, deny-ceiling algebra, replay==live
  proof, Junction inference, generation-eval methodology, data-flywheel privacy) and
  **adversarial** slices for its top abuse/failure modes (48 adversarial issues in total).
- The **role-based user-story walkthrough** (app dev / platform eng / GitOps / SecOps / SRE,
  + DevOps×2) is captured under Project 15 (CLI/MCP/DX) as `user-story` issues that thread across
  subsystems, with cross-project `blockedBy` to the verbs and contracts they exercise.
- `HOBO-11` (ADR ↔ implementation traceability audit, Foundations) is the standing gate that
  confirms every ADR/Plan maps to ≥1 issue; with all 15 subsystems now populated, every ADR file
  (01-architecture-core, 02-identity-security, 03-data-plane, 07-portability-extensibility) and the
  design-suite features map onto at least one branch-sized slice.
