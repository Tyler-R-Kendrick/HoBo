# anti-slop — stack state

```

Full-repo `pnpm run lint:slop` stays opt-in (large backlog). Pre-commit and
`agent:check` run `lint:slop:changed` on touched TS/JS with `--deny-warnings`.
Skill-tree edits now also select `skills:mirror-check`.

## Next slices (file-complete, not warning-only)

The changed-file gate lints the **whole file**. A warning-only pass over
`scripts/` fails because those files still carry anti-slop errors. Current
`scripts/` count: 127 errors / 16 warnings (57 files). Highest error counts:

- `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion`
- `no-runtime-typeof`
- `no-known-value-widening`
- `no-unsafe-dictionary-type`

Each follow-up PR should take **one file (or a tight cluster) to zero
findings**, then stop. Do not edit a file that still has other anti-slop
errors.

Cleared: entire `scripts/` tree (layer 3). Layer 4: root competitor/council tests.
Layer 5: example files taken to zero findings (named JsonValue parse
boundaries, UsageReader returns, Firecrawl client injection instead of
`vi.mock`). Next: `site/` then `packages/` / `src/draft/` file-complete
slices. Full-repo `lint:slop --deny-warnings` is still red until those land.
