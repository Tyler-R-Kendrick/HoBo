/**
 * Copy the shipped art in from site/ before every build.
 *
 * This used to be a one-off manual copy, and it went stale immediately: the
 * catalogue kept showing the old sky, poles and trail for a whole round of
 * fixes while claiming to be the place you look at the art. A catalogue that
 * can disagree with the product is worse than no catalogue.
 *
 * site/ stays the owner — it is what the live site loads. This only mirrors.
