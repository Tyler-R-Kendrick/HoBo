/**
 * Impedance findings — the honest record of what a Drizzle schema module said
 * that the canonical schema IR cannot say back.
 *
 * ADR-0144 makes impedance a first-class output rather than a footnote: an
 * adapter that quietly drops a construct it does not understand is claiming a
 * fidelity it does not have. Every construct this adapter meets is either
 * represented in the IR or named here with a code and a detail string. There is
 * no third bucket, and ingestion never throws over an unrecognized construct —
 * a finding is the answer, not a failure.
