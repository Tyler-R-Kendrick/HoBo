// CUE constraints for the OpenSesame secrets adapter. src/binding.ts and
// src/outcome.ts parse into these shapes; test/binding.test.ts reads the
// regular expressions below out of this file and checks the parser carries
// the same ones, so there is one definition.

// A binding names a credential and bounds what a surrogate for it may do.
// An unbounded scope is unrepresentable: `paths` and `methods` are non-empty,
// which mirrors the plugin's own refusal to issue a surrogate for an entry
// with no bounded scope.
