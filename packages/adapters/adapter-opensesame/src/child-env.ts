/**
 * The environment a proxied run starts from. It is built, not inherited:
 * OpenSesame hands its child everything it was started with except the store
 * passphrase and the names a binding overwrites, so whatever this process
 * passes OpenSesame reaches the command. A caller's environment routinely holds
 * credentials (AWS_*, GITHUB_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, a real VERCEL_TOKEN),
 * and the point of the run is that the command holds only a surrogate. So the
 * environment is an allowlist of what a command needs to run, plus the names the
 * caller lists in `passEnv`, plus the run's own two variables; everything else
 * stays behind.
 *
 * A listed name is the caller's explicit choice and is passed as it is. What is
 * never passed, listed or not, is a credential for a provider this run brokers:
 * if the process already holds one, the run is refused (`real_credential_in_env`)
 * rather than started beside it.
