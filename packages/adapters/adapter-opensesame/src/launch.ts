/**
 * Launching a command under OpenSesame, so it holds `osr_` surrogates and never
 * a token: `opensesame dev --agent --schema <file> run -- <cmd...>` with the
 * `.env.schema` this adapter rendered from reference-only bindings.
 *
 * `buildLaunch` is pure: it checks what must hold before anything starts (this
 * process is not itself such a child, this Node can send `fetch` through
 * `HTTPS_PROXY`, the env-spec bridge named by OPENSESAME_ENV_PARSE exists, no
 * real credential for a bound provider is already in the environment) and
 * returns the argv and the environment it builds: an allowlist plus `passEnv`
 * (`child-env.ts`), not the caller's. `runProxied` finds and identifies the
 * `opensesame` (`opensesame-bin.ts`), writes the schema 0600 in a directory of its
 * own, runs it, passes the signals it is sent on to OpenSesame, reads how it
 * ended, and removes the schema when the run ends, throws, or is interrupted.
 * `supervise.ts` says what that covers and what it cannot (SIGKILL, a crash).
 *
 * The store passphrase is never read or set here. OpenSesame takes it from the
 * terminal, or from OPENSESAME_STORE_PASSWORD when the caller lists that name in
 * `passEnv`, and only after `--version` has identified the executable; it strips
 * the passphrase from the command itself.
