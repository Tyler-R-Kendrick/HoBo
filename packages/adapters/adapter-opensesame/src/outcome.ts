/**
 * How one `opensesame dev --agent run` ended, read from what it leaves: its
 * exit status and the lines it prints on stderr. This is the process boundary
 * the pact in contracts/ pins.
 *
 * What the binary really does (apps/cli/src/dev_run.rs, dev_supervise.rs,
 * dev_surrogate.rs, dev_credentials.rs, log_sink.rs), and where the status
 * alone is not enough:
 *
 * - the child's own status is passed through; a child killed by a signal is 1;
 * - a tripwire (`surrogate.misdirected`) exits 77, and so can a child, so 77
 *   counts as a tripwire only beside OpenSesame's own line;
 * - SIGTERM or SIGHUP to OpenSesame exits 143 or 129 after revoking the run,
 *   and so can a child, so the same rule applies;
 * - every refusal before the child starts (pin mismatch, an unreadable entry,
 *   a scope the plugin will not issue, a schema that does not parse) is a
 *   fatal error: `Error: <message>` on stderr, status 1;
 * - a run with no plugin, no entry or no brokerable connection starts anyway,
 *   exits as the child does, and hands the child a placeholder. Only a line
 *   on stderr says so, which is why that line is read at all: a green exit
 *   with a placeholder is the false pass this adapter exists to refuse.
 *
 * Only sentences in the shape OpenSesame writes (the closed set below) are read,
 * and a refusal needs a failing status beside it. The `opensesame: ` sentences
 * (tripwire, signal, placeholders) and the pin-mismatch sentence are matched
 * anywhere in the retained stderr, because OpenSesame prints its end-of-run line
 * with no newline before it and a child's unterminated last write, or a spinner
 * ending on a carriage return, leaves it glued to the child's text; the other
 * `Error:` classes are printed before the child exists and so start a line. The
 * child shares stderr, so it can print any of these: that gains it a fail-closed
 * kind (a tripwire, a refusal, a placeholder) and never a pass, and nothing it
 * wrote survives except the exit status it chose. A status of 77, 143 or 129 is advisory beside its line, since a
 * child can return them itself. The gate that a surrogate was really delivered is
 * the SecretsPort, which checks the child's own variable and the run's markers.
 *
 * No text produced by the child, or by a line it could have forged, is ever
 * copied into a `ProxiedRunOutcome` or an error: the notice is a fixed sentence
 * chosen by the kind. Any other `Error:` line is the child's own failure
 * (every uncaught Node exception starts that way) and is reported as a
 * `child_exit` with the status and no words.
