/**
 * The OpenSesame SecretsPort (ADR-0113 residual port, ADR-0027 ladder rank
 * `provider-federation`): the credential HoBo holds is the run's `osr_`
 * surrogate, which OpenSesame's proxy swaps for the real token at the
 * provider's own host. The real credential never enters HoBo.
 *
 * `access` reads the variable a binding names from the environment the process
 * was started with under `opensesame dev --agent run`, and serves it only when
 * it is shaped like a surrogate AND the same environment carries the markers of
 * a run `runProxied` started: HOBO_OPENSESAME_CHILD=1, NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 and
 * an HTTPS_PROXY on loopback. That is shape plus run markers, not cryptographic
 * provenance: the port cannot ask OpenSesame whether a surrogate is live, so an
 * `osr_` copied from another run into an environment that also fakes all three
 * markers would pass. What it stops is the plain mistakes: a surrogate pasted or
 * left over, served as material, then sent straight to the provider with no proxy. A placeholder (`ostest_`), an absent variable
 * and a plain token the person exported are all denied as `placeholders_only`:
 * a run without the plugin exits 0 and hands the child a placeholder, and
 * against an emulator that accepts any token that is a false green.
 *
 * Secrets enter by a person's `opensesame pass insert`, never through HoBo, so
 * `put` is read-only.
