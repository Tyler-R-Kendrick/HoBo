// here by configuration, not by a skip: a skipped real test reads as a passed one.
//
// Most tests here start processes (the stand-in is a Node script that starts the
// command, itself Node), up to four in a row. On a busy machine one start takes
// seconds, so vitest's 5 s default fails tests whose assertions held. The
// budget is a deadline for the machine, not the property under test: what
// must be fast says so itself (the stderr read ends within 10 s of a held
// pipe, a hostile line is read in under 500 ms).
