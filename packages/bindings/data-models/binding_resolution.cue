// Binding resolution + binding.* event invariants (ADR-0157).
//
// Three constraints here are load-bearing rather than decorative. A resolution
// must have considered at least one candidate — something was chosen, so
// something existed to choose from, and a zero here means the record was
// synthesized rather than decided. A YARD_BINDING_EXCLUDED_ALL refusal must
// likewise have considered at least one candidate, because rows can only
// exclude candidates that existed to be excluded; a zero there is really
// YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN or NO_COMPATIBLE_BINDING mislabelled. And
// remediation is non-empty on every refusal, because a refusal without
// remediation is a dead end for the operator.
//
// The event family is closed at three names. There is no binding.Declared:
// Yard binding row state rides yard.Registered, so row state is never
// duplicated across two streams.
