 * ADR-0151 selection, never a ranking input. What survives that filtering is a
 * `BindingResolution` — a decision record, not a decision procedure. It exists
 * so the choice is auditable: it names the Yard, the profile, the chosen
 * product and connectivity, how the capability is realized, which canonical
 * Yard binding row keys constrained the outcome, and how many candidates were
 * considered. `packages/cloud` produces it; this package owns its shape so the
 * planner and the event log cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Everything here is a parse boundary. A resolution arriving from another
 * package is untrusted structurally (it crosses a package seam) and untrusted
 * for content (a provider product id is provider-supplied text). Both are
 * checked before a frozen record exists.
