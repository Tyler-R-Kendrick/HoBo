/**
 * The container component builder.
 *
 * This is authoring surface: every method returns the handle so a caller can
 * chain, and the result is the record a deploy is planned from. The risk in a
 * builder like this is not that a method throws — it is that a method quietly
 * replaces something the caller already set. Volumes, args, bind mounts and
 * waits all accumulate, and each is written as "read the existing list, push,
 * write it back" precisely so a second call adds rather than overwrites. A
 * builder that clobbered would produce a container missing a volume nobody
 * noticed was dropped.
 *
 * The other property worth naming: **`withDnsRecord` refuses.** DNS is
 * Yard-level and outside the bind-reference contract, and a builder that
 * silently accepted a DNS record would record an intent nothing downstream
 * honours — a hostname the author believes exists and nothing ever creates.
