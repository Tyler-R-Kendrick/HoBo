/**
 * App Kits, webApp detection, the `env` dual surface, and the connector
 * registry.
 *
 * Four small surfaces that share one trait: each answers a question by
 * *classification*, and a wrong answer is silent. A kind wrongly classified as
 * an App Kit gets Session Replay attached to something that hosts no
 * entrypoint; a binding wrongly classified as a web app gets a framework
 * annotation naming a root that does not exist; a connector looked up before
 * its package was imported would otherwise resolve to nothing.
 *
 * The webApp detector is the subtlest. It reads well-known symbols that
 * framework packages stamp onto their binding function, and it is *structural*
 * — no import of Wasp or Convex, no instanceof. That is what lets a framework
 * package participate without this package depending on it. The cost is that
 * every field has to be checked: a stamped meta object with a non-string root,
 * or an empty one, has to be rejected rather than carried into an annotation
 * that would send a build looking for a directory nobody named.
