## Hosting budget admission

`resolveBindleDeployment` ranks compatible Yards using trusted, normalized,
whole-request hosting quotes. Capacity is never a substitute for price. A quote
contains itemized expected cost and a separate conservative liability bound in
integer USD microdollars. Unknown, stale, foreign, unbounded or unaffordable
quotes are ineligible. The provider and tenant on every quote must match the
selected Yard; residual resources stay within that Yard's provider.

Funded hosting requires `hostingBudget: {authority, quotes, now}` and a bound
`authorizeHosting` callback. The callback returns the existing `GateDecision`
plus a generated `HostingPolicyProof` tied to request digest, quote, budget
identity/revision and policy hash. Denials, pending approvals and unfulfilled
obligations refuse admission. A successful receipt pins proof, quote and financial
reservation. The zero-cost local host floor remains available; the local seed
cannot impersonate a remote provider.

`createSqliteBudgetAdmissionAuthority({path, snapshot, now})` is the concrete
local durable adapter. Every operation reloads the authoritative journal under
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; journal commit and acknowledgement are atomic. Separate local
connections/processes share the same file. Reopen restores held and uncertain
reservations and idempotent terminal records. Distributed hosts require a shared
transactional database adapter to `BudgetAdmissionAuthority`; copying a SQLite
file or creating one ledger per worker does not establish shared authority.
The in-memory factory is explicitly marked `persistence: 'memory'` and cannot
authorize funded Yard hosting.

One transaction reserves global money, provider-account ceilings and each named
free-allocation bucket. Quantities use integer normalized base units; unknown
accounts, units, periods and expired allowance evidence refuse admission. Every
entitlement must have one authoritative owner, including across budget scopes;
independent ledgers may not duplicate a provider account's free allocation.
`unresolvedMicros`, `externalCommittedMicros` and `recoveryReserveMicros` remain
protected in every reserve calculation. `reservedMicros` is exclusively the
authority's journal-derived holds; external commitments use their separate field.

`settle` requires confirmed source retirement and authoritative usage evidence,
including complete actual account charges and entitlement consumption when those
dimensions were reserved. Actual overruns are recorded and consume remaining
headroom. Unknown outcomes retain all holds. `release` requires positive evidence
that the reservation was unused. Policy revisions cannot erase commitments, and
period rollover refuses while journal-owned work remains outstanding. Reducing
external unresolved/committed exposure requires reconciliation evidence.
Zero-cash holds also block rollover: fully credited work still owns its allocation.
Spent account watermarks cannot disappear within a financial period.

`claimExecution` atomically binds a gateway's existing financial reservation to one
transition digest. Replay of that same execution reuses the hold; another execution
cannot claim it. This avoids reserving the same deployment twice while preserving
the financial plan hash and pinned quote identity through crash recovery.
Funded Yard generation claims its hold before calling the provider connector, so
a concurrent unused cancellation cannot release in-flight provisioning liability.
An identical claimed generation retry inspects the original operation instead of
provisioning it again; unknown outcomes retain their financial exposure.

Generated wire records live in `data-models/yard_placement.proto`; constraints
live in `data-models/budget.cue`. The message Pact is hand-authored offline port
evidence, not provider-verified billing evidence. Regression tests exercise the
real SQLite adapter, competing connections, crash/reopen, policy changes,
protected reserves, free-allocation exhaustion and quote selection.

## Budget signal migration and metered preflight

Versioned signal policies supply `identity: {tenantId,budgetId,periodId,policyRevision}`.
Usage and credit facts must name the matching `budgetId` and `periodId`.
`budget.StateReset` explicitly initializes each new identity; threshold cycle
keys include the whole identity. Replays emit no duplicate resets or crossings.
Changing a cap or threshold set requires a new revision. Unscoped legacy policies
retain tenant/lifetime semantics for existing consumers and have no period rollover
guarantee; new hosting controls use versioned identities.

Zero USD budget or per-resolution cap means zero, never unlimited. Unlimited
preflight behavior requires `budgetUnlimited` or `spendCapUnlimited` explicitly.
`createMeteredBillingPlane` rereads a live event reader on each authorization and
holds outstanding request identities atomically within that one plane. Consumable
snapshot iterators are rejected. A finalized usage fact may retire a hold only by
naming its reservation ID. This legacy preflight is single-writer and is not the
durable financial authority for funded cloud hosting.

The **HoBo Broker**: the policy-governed authority that actually brokers
Bindle/Camp/Yard/Junction placements **across providers**, spins resources up
and down, and hands accepted work to delivery — based on the configured
policies the broker itself maintains. It is the runtime counterpart of the
[Meta-cloud Broker design](../../docs/design/hobo-broker.md); the Meta-cloud
Broker artifact vocabulary (Contract Manifest → Resolution Receipt /
Resolution Rejection) is preserved here as the receipt/rejection wire shapes.

This broker is **distinct** from the Identity token broker (ADR-0008) and the
connector runtime broker (HOBO-235): those broker *credentials*; this package
brokers *placements*. The connector registry below stores `credentialRef`
pointers into the token broker — never raw secrets.

## What it wraps

The broker is a wrapper around five planes, each behind a port so engines can
be swapped without touching the brokering pipeline:

| Plane | Port | Default engine | Alternate engine (shipped in this package) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policy | `GatePlane` (OPA-shaped request/decision documents) | `@hobo/contracts` policy pack (imported and **run**, not reinvented) | **Rego** via `createOpaGatePlane` — OPA Data API decision at `hobo/broker/decision`, fail-closed (`policy-engine-unavailable`), pinned by `broker_policy_opa.pact.json` |
| Contracts | `GatePlane` (can-deploy compatibility) | `@hobo/contracts` Gatekeeper (PACT-style boundary semantics) | an external Pact broker verification feed (port-compatible) |
| Billing | `BillingPlane` | in-proc budget + spend-cap + quota checks | `createMeteredBillingPlane` — folds `meter.UsageRecorded` facts into observed spend and authorizes against the metered remaining budget |
| Delivery | `DeliveryPlane` | `renderArgoApplication` → Argo CD Application documents; `in-proc` executor handoff | `createArgoCdDeliveryPlane` — live Argo CD applications API submission, token via the token broker, fail-closed, pinned by `broker_delivery_argocd.pact.json` |
| Connectors | `ConnectorRegistry` | event-sourced registry of `github-app`, `pulumi`, `azure`, `vercel`, `cloudflare`, `custom` configs | an external connector catalog |

Beyond M0, this package also ships:

- **Receipt integrity** — Ed25519 detached signatures over canonical JSON for
  every receipt and rejection (`signResolution`/`verifyResolution`,
  `broker.ResolutionSigned` facts).
- **The closed rejection matrix** (`REJECTION_MATRIX`) — every broker-owned
  rejection code pinned to its plane and an agent-actionable remediation,
  test-enforced against the pipeline.
- **Cedar** as the second external policy language (`createCedarGatePlane`,
  fail-closed, pinned by `broker_policy_cedar.pact.json`) beside Rego.
- **Broker Environments** (admin controls): `publishEnvironmentFact` /
  `approveEnvironmentFact` / `foldBrokerEnvironments`; resolutions against an
  unapproved environment or a stale pinned catalog snapshot reject
  (`environment-unapproved`, `catalog-snapshot-stale`), and eligibility is
  bounded to the environment's approved providers.
- **The hosted authority surface** — `createBrokerHttpHandler` / `serveBroker`
  expose resolve/scale/deliver/rejection-matrix over HTTP, and the resolve
  route is PROVIDER-verified against `broker_resolution.pact.json`
  (`contracts/provider/`). The `hobo broker` CLI verb (and its derived MCP
  tool) runs the same pipeline against the composed Yard's live registry.

Branding note: product surfaces call this component **the Conductor**; code
and technical docs keep **broker**.

Placement itself consumes any `BrokerCatalog` — a structural mirror of
`@hobo/cloud`'s `PlannerRegistry`, so the Yard's live provider catalog plugs
in directly.

## Command/event model

The broker is an **actor**: it consumes commands (`resolve`, `scale`,
`deliver`, connector `register`/`disable`), coordinates durable state through
the facts it emits, and never mutates a query read model directly. Event
families:

- `broker.Requested` → `broker.Resolved` (receipt) or `broker.Rejected`
  (structured per-plane reasons), with the Gatekeeper's `policy.Decided` /
  `gatekeeper.Decided` facts appended to the same stream for replay.
- `broker.ScaleRequested` — spin up/down/zero directives.
- `broker.DeliverySubmitted` — delivery-plane handoff.
- `connector.Registered` / `connector.Disabled` — connector registry facts.

Query surfaces are event-driven: `foldBrokerDecisions` and
`foldConnectorRegistry` are pure folds over the **event store** stream into
**materialized view** rows (each **projection** rebuilds from zero), and
`snapshotBrokerDecisions`/`restoreBrokerDecisions` persist a **snapshot** of
the current rows to a **read store** for cached current reads; replaying the
stream over a restored snapshot yields the same view.

## Parse, don't validate

Untrusted policy documents, brokering requests, connector configs, and scale
directives cross exactly one parser boundary (`parseBrokerPolicySet`,
`parseBrokerRequest`, `parseConnectorConfig`, `parseScaleDirective`). The
parsers apply the protobuf + CUE constraints from `data-models/broker.proto`
and `data-models/broker.cue` and return refined **parsed domain types**
(`src/types.ts`, including the branded `PolicyHash` derived type), so invalid
values are unrepresentable past the boundary — core functions never re-check
raw DTOs.

## Policy semantics

Placement policies are maintained per topology scope kind. The effective
policy for a request merges junction → yard → camp → bindle: narrower scopes
override choice-shaped fields (objective, allowed providers/regions, pins),
while restrictions **accumulate** — a junction broker admin's
`requireExplicitCamps` lockdown or denied-provider list can never be relaxed
by a narrower policy. Every receipt and rejection pins `policyHash` (the
content address of the whole policy set) and `catalogHash`, so a decision is
replayable against the exact policies and catalog that produced it.

## Boundary contract

The consumer-driven PACT contract for the resolve boundary lives in
[`contracts/pacts/broker_resolution.pact.json`](contracts/pacts/broker_resolution.pact.json),
exercised by `contracts/consumer/broker-resolution-boundary.test.ts`.

## Verification

```sh
pnpm --filter @hobo/broker test
pnpm --filter @hobo/broker test:contract:consumer
