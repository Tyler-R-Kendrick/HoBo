/**
 * Parsing and building a Bindle deployment request.
 *
 * This is the boundary where a Bindle's *requirements* meet a Yard's
 * *placement*, and it enforces the separation that the whole placement model
 * rests on:
 *
 * **A Bindle may not select a provider.** `provider` or `providerId` at the
 * top level is refused outright — with its own error code, not a generic parse
 * failure — because provider selection belongs to Yard placement. A Bindle that
 * could name its own cloud would make every placement policy advisory: the
 * Broker's residency rules, cost objectives and generation approvals all assume
 * they decide where work lands.
 *
 * The refusal is a *smuggling* check rather than a schema omission, and that is
 * why it is worth a test: the field is not merely unsupported, it is actively
 * detected and rejected, and the code says so.
 *
 * The builder side (`buildDeploymentRequestFromParts`) exists so the CLI does
 * not hand-roll this structure. Two of its defaults are decisions rather than
 * conveniences:
 *
 * **Selection mode follows the yard id.** Naming a yard means `exact` — you
 * asked for that one. Not naming one means `compatible-or-generate`, because
 * the alternative is failing a first deploy on a machine with no yards yet.
 *
 * **Only local hosts get a component-host list.** A cloud yard declares its own
 * substrate; asserting `["local", "wasm", "oci"]` on its behalf would match a
 * yard that cannot actually run those.
