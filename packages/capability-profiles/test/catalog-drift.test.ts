/**
 * `@hobo/core`'s typed capability catalog and this package's standard profile
 * registry must name exactly the same profiles.
 *
 * They are two copies on purpose: core is layer 0 and cannot import this
 * package, but provider packages at layer 2 need typed profile names at their
 * authoring sites. Two copies drift unless something checks, so this checks —
 * in both directions, because each direction fails differently and both
 * failures are silent:
 *
 * - A profile in the registry but not in core's catalog is defined but
 *   unnameable through the typed surface, so authors fall back to a string
 *   literal and lose every guarantee the catalog exists to give.
 * - A profile in core's catalog but not in the registry autocompletes, compiles,
 *   and then matches nothing at resolution — the worst of the three failure
 *   modes, because it looks correct at the call site.
 *
 * The slot assignment is checked too. Core says which slot holds a profile;
 * `@hobo/yards` refuses a row filed under a slot whose profile family belongs
 * elsewhere (`SLOT_PROFILE_MISMATCH`). If core's grouping disagreed with the
 * family grammar, the typed surface would hand authors a value the parse
 * boundary then rejects.
