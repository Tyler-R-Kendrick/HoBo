/**
 * Tests for the E2E fixture runner.
 *
 * The module was 0% covered. It is what CI actually invokes per phase, and its
 * only durable output is a JSONL event log that later steps and humans read to
 * decide whether a run was clean. Three properties matter and none was pinned:
 * the right event is appended for each phase, a failed live-URL assertion still
 * records the failure *before* throwing, and teardown never depends on deploy
 * having succeeded.
 *
 * Everything is driven through a temp `eventsPath`, so no test touches the real
 * `test-results/` directory.
