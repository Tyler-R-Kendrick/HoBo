/**
 * This validator is the thing that stops CI's own safety properties eroding.
 * Each check corresponds to a rule somebody deliberately established — the PR
 * gate blocks, E2E authenticates by OIDC rather than a stored secret, the
 * sandbox role is not wildcarded, teardown runs even when the job fails — and
 * every one of them is enforced by a single `if` that pushes a violation.
 *
 * The existing suite verifies that a correct contract passes. That is the half
 * which cannot fail informatively: a validator that returned `passed: true`
 * unconditionally would satisfy it completely, and CI would keep reporting a
 * green contract while every rule it encodes quietly stopped being checked.
 *
 * So this file breaks one invariant at a time and asserts the specific code
 * that comes back. The code matters as much as the failure: it is what a
 * developer greps for when the guard rejects their change, and a violation that
 * reported the wrong one would send them to fix the wrong thing.
