/**
 * Admission controls for anonymous deployment.
 *
 * Anonymous provisioning spends someone's money and someone's free tier, so it
 * is gated before an offer is ever compiled. This module is the pure decision
 * function: counters, budgets, and the clock are inputs, and the verdict is a
 * typed allow or a typed refusal with a stable code. Nothing here calls a
 * provider or reads a clock — the caller passes `nowMs` from the same canonical
 * instant the rest of resolution uses.
