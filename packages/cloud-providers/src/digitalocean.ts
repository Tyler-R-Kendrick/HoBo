/**
 * DigitalOcean: the default Yard, plus the slot factories for authoring your own.
 *
 * `Yard()` returns everything DigitalOcean *can* allocate — a catalog, not a
 * selection. Which offering a given resource gets is decided later, by ADR-0151
 * selection, against the requirements the app actually states.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: `@hobo/provider-digitalocean` ships resolvers for 12 of its 15
 * catalogued products, exercised against an injected fake transport, and
 * registers no Resource Definitions for the `digitalocean.*` product ids — so a
 * deploy against this Yard still fails closed at resolution until definitions
 * land. The three without resolvers are the ones DigitalOcean's own API shape
 * makes non-convergent, named in `DIGITALOCEAN_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS`.
 * `queue`, `topic` and `secretRef` carry no rows at all, because DigitalOcean
 * sells no first-party queue and no first-party secret store.
