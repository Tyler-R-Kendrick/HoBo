/**
 * GCP: the default Yard, plus the slot factories for authoring your own.

 * `Yard()` returns everything GCP *can* allocate — a catalog, not a selection.
 * Which offering a given resource gets is decided later, by ADR-0151 selection,
 * against the requirements the app actually states.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: `@hobo/provider-gcp` ships no deployment resolvers, so nothing
 * here deploys. A deploy against this Yard fails closed at resolution until
 * Resource Definitions and resolvers land for the `gcp.*` product ids.
