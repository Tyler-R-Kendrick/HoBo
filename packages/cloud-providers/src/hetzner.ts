/**
 * Hetzner: the default Yard, plus the slot factories for authoring your own.
 *
 * `Yard()` returns everything Hetzner *can* allocate — a catalog, not a
 * selection. Which offering a given resource gets is decided later, by ADR-0151
 * selection, against the requirements the app actually states.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: this is the narrowest catalog in the package, and deliberately
 * so. Hetzner sells virtual machines, networking and storage; it sells no
 * managed database, cache, queue, topic or secret store, so five slots carry no
 * rows and an app that needs Postgres gets a truthful `none` here rather than a
 * machine it would have to administer. `@hobo/provider-hetzner` ships resolvers
 * for 3 of its 5 catalogued products (Cloud Servers, Load Balancers, Volumes),
 * exercised against an injected fake transport; the other two live on hosts the
 * transport guard deliberately does not allowlist. No Resource Definitions are
 * registered, so a deploy against this Yard still fails closed at resolution.
