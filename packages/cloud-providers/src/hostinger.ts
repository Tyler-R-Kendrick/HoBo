/**
 * Hostinger: the default Yard, plus the slot factories for authoring your own.
 *
 * `Yard()` returns everything Hostinger *can* allocate — a catalog, not a
 * selection. Which offering a given resource gets is decided later, by ADR-0151
 * selection, against the requirements the app actually states.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — this provider works differently from the others here. On
 * Hostinger, allocation is a *purchase*: a VPS, a hosting plan and the MySQL
 * database that comes with it are obtained by placing a billing order, and the
 * API manages instances you already own. `@hobo/provider-hostinger`'s resolvers
 * therefore adopt-and-converge rather than create, and refuse with remediation
 * when there is nothing to adopt — a refusal its transport guard enforces by
 * not allowlisting the order-placing namespace at all. Two of its five
 * catalogued products have resolvers; `bucket`, `kv`, `queue`, `topic` and
 * `secretRef` carry no rows, because Hostinger sells none of them.
