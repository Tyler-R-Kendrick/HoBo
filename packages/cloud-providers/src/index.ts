/**
 * `@hobo/cloud-providers` — one import for every cloud's default Yard.
 *
 * The authoring shape this package exists to serve:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { aws, azure, cloudflare } from "@hobo/cloud-providers";
 * import { defineStation } from "@hobo/yards";
 *
 * export default defineStation("acme", {
 *   yards: [aws.Yard(), azure.Yard(), cloudflare.Yard({ regions: ["weur"] })],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Each namespace exposes `Yard()` — the provider's full allocatable catalog,
 * parsed into a real `Yard` — alongside that provider's slot factories, so
 * narrowing or re-parameterizing a catalog uses the same typed vocabulary the
 * default is built from:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { defineYard } from "@hobo/yards";
 * import { azure } from "@hobo/cloud-providers";
 *
 * // Only the offerings this team is willing to run.
 * export const prod = defineYard("prod-eu", {
 *   provider: "azure",
 *   region: "westeurope",
 *   web: [azure.containerApps({ ingress: "external" }), azure.aks({ replicas: 3 })],
 *   data: azure.postgresFlexible({ tier: "GeneralPurpose" }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A Yard is a **catalog, not an inventory** (ADR-0157 decision 1): its rows say
 * what the provider *is able to* allocate, so several entries per capability is
 * the normal case and declaring one allocates nothing. Selection among them
 * happens at resolution time under ADR-0151's hard gates and lexicographic
 * ranking — never here.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE, per provider. No namespace here has registered Resource
 * Definitions for its product ids, so a deploy against any of these Yards
 * fails closed at resolution rather than half-applying; what differs is how
 * much of a real API each provider package can already talk to, and every one
 * of those is proven against an injected fake transport rather than a live
 * account:
 *   - **cloudflare**, **vercel** — HTTP deployment resolvers.
 *   - **aws** (7/19), **gcp** (9/14), **azure** (9/16),
 *     **digitalocean** (9/14), **hetzner** (3/5) — signed or bearer-token
 *     resolvers for part of the catalog; each package names the products it
 *     cannot converge and why.
 *   - **kubernetes** (6/7) — convergent resolvers for built-in objects, plus a
 *     placement driver that does reach a real apiserver. Its catalog is
 *     built-ins only: databases, caches and queues arrive through operators,
 *     which are software this package cannot see.
 *   - **hostinger** (2/5) — the odd one out: allocation there is a *billing
 *     order*, so its resolvers adopt and converge what you already bought and
 *     refuse to purchase. Its transport guard does not allowlist the
 *     order-placing namespace, so that refusal is enforced below the code.
