/**
 * Kubernetes: the default Yard, plus the slot factories for authoring your own.
 *
 * `Yard()` returns every built-in object a conformant cluster *can* allocate —
 * a catalog, not a selection. Which offering a given resource gets is decided
 * later, by ADR-0151 selection, against the requirements the app actually
 * states.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: the catalog is built-ins only. Kubernetes provides no database,
 * cache, queue or topic — those arrive through operators, which are third-party
 * software an operator installs into a cluster — so those four slots carry no
 * rows, and a row for one would be a claim about somebody else's software.
 * `@hobo/provider-kubernetes` ships convergent resolvers for eight of its nine
 * catalogued products, exercised against an injected fake apiserver; the ninth
 * is the Secret row, which ships no resolver because creating a Secret means
 * putting its contents in a record that is written to the event log. No Resource Definitions are registered for the `kubernetes.*` product
 * ids, so a deploy routed through this Yard still fails closed at resolution.
 *
 * The `regions` option is topology labels for the cluster's nodes, not a
 * provider region list: where a cluster's nodes run is a fact about the
 * infrastructure underneath it, which the Kubernetes API does not report and
 * this package will not guess.
