/**
 * Vercel: the default Yard, plus the slot factories for authoring your own.
 *
 * `Yard()` returns everything Vercel *can* allocate. Unlike Azure or GCP, most
 * Vercel slots hold exactly one entry — not because the catalog is abridged,
 * but because Vercel genuinely ships one product per capability. A single entry
 * here is an accurate catalog, not a selection made early.
 *
 * SCOPE: Vercel is one of the two providers that ships HTTP deployment
 * resolvers, so this catalog is backed by real Vercel API drivers. Those
 * drivers are proven against an injected fake transport; a live deploy
 * additionally needs real credentials and network egress, which no test here
 * supplies.
