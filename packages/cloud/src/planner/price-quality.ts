/**
 * Whether a cost decision is worth claiming.
 *
 * ADR-0071 makes placement cost-aware and Plan 5 estimates at plan time. Both
 * rest on accurate multi-provider price data, and the design treated that data
 * as free. It is not: Infracost built a business on a Cloud Pricing API, and
 * Vantage publishes prices as a distribution strategy precisely because
 * assembling them is expensive.
 *
 * Resourcing that data — building, licensing, or consuming someone else's — is
 * a commercial decision. Scoping the *claim* to what HoBo can actually price is
 * an engineering one, and this module is that scoping expressed as something
 * that fails rather than as a paragraph in a design doc.
 *
 * ## The fault it addresses
 *
 * The catalog cannot currently distinguish an unpriced offering from a free
 * one, and that is not a cosmetic problem:
 *
 *   - `ResourceDefinition.cost.marginalPrice` is a bare decimal string. The
 *     `currency` that `CostSignal` carried is dropped on the way in, and no
 *     source or staleness travels with it.
 *   - Every default in the repo — `@hobo/sdk`, the local provider, the
 *     event-rehydration path — is `marginalPrice: "0"`.
 *   - The planner ranks by `Number.parseFloat(marginalPrice)`. So under
 *     `min-cost`, a provider that declared *nothing* scores zero and beats
 *     every provider that declared a real price. Silence wins the auction.
 *   - An unparseable price becomes `+Infinity` and quietly loses, so a typo in
 *     a manifest is indistinguishable from an expensive offering.
 *
 * ## The decision
 *
 * A price says what it is worth: `priced`, `unpriced`, or `unparseable`. A
 * cost-objective decision made over candidates that are not all priced is
 * **not claimable as cost-optimal** — the ranking still happens, because a
 * planner that refuses to place anything is worse than one that places without
 * boasting, but the claim is withheld and the unpriced candidates are named.
 *
 * A real zero stays expressible through `priceDeclared`, because a free tier
 * has to be modellable. The difference between a claim and a default is that
 * someone said it.
