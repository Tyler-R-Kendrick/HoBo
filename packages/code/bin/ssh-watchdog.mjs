/**
 * The watchdog the interactive shell runs its forward's ssh under.
 *
 * Usage: node ssh-watchdog.mjs <lease-deadline-ms> <command> [args...]
 *
 * The shell starts ssh detached, so that the launcher's signal to hobo-code's
 * process group cannot end it before the shell has closed the authorization
 * in order. Detached, ssh would outlive a shell that never got to quit: a
 * crash, or SIGKILL, which no handler sees. This watchdog ties ssh's life to
 * the shell's anyway. Its stdin is a pipe the shell's process holds, and that
 * pipe ends however the process ends, SIGKILL included: then the watchdog
 * ends ssh. It ends ssh at the authorization's lease too (the deadline, in
 * milliseconds since the epoch), even if the shell's own timer cannot run.
 *
 * ssh runs in a process group of its own, which the watchdog signals whole:
 * SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a grace. A signal the shell sends the watchdog
 * (its stop) is passed on the same way. The watchdog ends as ssh did: with
 * ssh's status, or by ssh's signal.
