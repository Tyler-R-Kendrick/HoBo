/**
 * Herdr-style multi-pane tmux sessions.
 *
 * Previously the "multiplexer" was a picture: `buildMultiplexerStatus` drew
 * panes that corresponded to no real terminal. This drives tmux for real —
 * one window per registered agent, in a session you can detach from and
 * reattach to.
 *
 * The load-bearing idea is **uniform targets**: a locally spawned agent, a
 * local inference server, and an ssh'd remote host are all just a command
 * placed in a pane. Local inference is not a special case with its own
 * lifecycle; it is a target like any other, so detach/reattach, naming and
 * status work identically whether the work is on this box or another one.
