/**
 * `hobo-code session serve --host <machine>`: forward a resident session
 * browser over ssh, under the Station authorization the CLI opened for it.
 *
 * The entry point holds the ending signals from before that authorization is
 * opened (the `signals` dep, `src/signal-hold.ts`) until it has closed the
 * authorization, once this returns. Here a signal ends the forward, not the
 * process: ssh is stopped (SIGKILL after 5 s if it holds on), and the status
 * is 128+n. A signal that came before the forward began, while the
 * authorization was being opened, means it never begins: no browser address,
 * no ssh.
