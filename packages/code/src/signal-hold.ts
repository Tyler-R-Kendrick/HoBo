/**
 * Holding the signals that end hobo-code while it has something open that
 * the signal's default action would leave open.
 *
 * `session serve --host <machine>` opens a Station authorization, then runs
 * ssh, and closes the authorization when the forward ends. Node acts on a
 * signal only while something listens for it; with no listener the default
 * action ends the process where it stands. A signal that came before the
 * forward's listeners existed (while the authorization was being opened, or
 * while ssh was being started) ended hobo-code with the authorization open.
 *
 * A hold listens for every ending signal from `hold()` until `release()`. It
 * records the first, and calls whatever reacts to it meanwhile (`whileHeld`):
 * the one holding it decides what the signal ends, and when.
