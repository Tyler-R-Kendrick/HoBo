/**
 * Every `hobo-code` verb, answered on a machine with nothing set up.
 *
 * `cli-readonly-verb-surface.test.ts` beside this file covers fifteen verbs in
 * depth. This one goes the other way — every verb the CLI dispatches, driven
 * against a fresh empty `HOBO_HOME` — because the thing worth checking across
 * the whole surface is not what each verb *says* but that none of them fall
 * over on a machine where nothing exists yet. That is the state of every first
 * run, and it is the state a user is in precisely when they are most likely to
 * be typing verbs at random to find out what the tool does.
 *
 * Three properties hold across all of them:
 *
 * **A verb answers rather than throwing.** An unhandled exception out of the
 * CLI reaches the user as a stack trace, which is the worst possible answer to
 * "what is this tool" — it reads as a broken install rather than a missing
 * session.
 *
 * **Every answer carries a stable code, and the exit status matches it.** The
 * shell, the dashboard and every script branch on `result.code`; the exit
 * status is what a shell pipeline branches on. A verb whose `ok` disagreed
 * with its exit status would make `&&` chains behave differently from the UI
 * showing the same run.
 *
 * **"Nothing here yet" is not a failure.** `tasks`, `machines`, `session
 * list`, `template`, `review`, `dashboard`, `env` and the rest all succeed
 * with an empty station. Only three things legitimately fail on a bare
 * machine: `resume` and `compact` (there is no prior chat to resume or
 * shrink), and `init` (a capability the environment has to grant). Reporting
 * an empty station as an error would train a user to ignore CLI errors on
 * exactly the day they should not.
 *
 * Each run gets its own `HOBO_HOME`, so nothing leaks between tests and
 * nothing touches the developer's real station.
