/**
 * The Git pane's remaining verbs: the ones that reach for a remote, the ones
 * that need an approval digest, and the ones that only move focus.
 *
 * `git-terminal-pane-driver.test.ts` covers opening the pane, moving around,
 * staging, and the yes/no gate in front of discard. This file covers what is
 * left of the key dispatch, which is where the pane's two most consequential
 * shapes live.
 *
 * **An approval digest is not a yes/no question.** Commit, push, open-PR, stack
 * and merge do not ask "are you sure" — they print the exact effect and a
 * digest, and require that digest typed back. That is a deliberately different
 * gate from the local one: a discard destroys a file the operator can see,
 * while these five push work out of the machine, where nobody can take it back.
 * A prompt an operator can clear by holding `y` would not be a gate at all. The
 * tests assert that a *wrong* digest leaves nothing done, because a gate that
 * accepts anything typed is decoration.
 *
 * **A failing verb reports and stays open.** Against a repository with no
 * remote and no forge CLI, `pull`, stack and merge all fail — and the pane's
 * answer is a message in its own status line, not an exit. A pane that closed
 * on the first failure would drop the operator back to a shell with no
 * explanation of what went wrong. The message has to name the cause: "merge
 * failed" teaches nothing, while "gh pr failed: spawn gh ENOENT" tells the
 * operator what to install.
 *
 * Two of those failures happen *before* an approval is minted, so the stack and
 * merge cases here assert the failure rather than the approval text. Asserting
 * the approval would be asserting a string this environment cannot produce.
 * `fetch`, meanwhile, succeeds: `git fetch --prune` with no remote exits 0,
 * because there is nothing to fetch and that is not an error.
 *
 * As in the sibling file, a real `git` and a real worktree are used: a faked git
 * would let the pane and the fake agree with each other while both are wrong.
 * Every run ends in a quit key and a deadline, because the loop reads until `q`
 * and a forgotten quit would hang the suite rather than fail it.
