/**
 * The Git pane's interactive loop, driven against a real worktree.
 *
 * The sibling `git-terminal-pane.test.ts` covers the pure layer — prompt
 * parsing, selection movement, the frame. This file covers `runGitTerminalPane`
 * itself: the key dispatch, the terminal it borrows, and the approval gates in
 * front of everything destructive.
 *
 * Three properties shape every case here.
 *
 * **Destructive actions are gated, and the gate is a real question.** Discard,
 * branch delete, commit revert and stash drop all route through a prompt that
 * must be answered `yes`. Anything else — a stray key, an escape, an empty
 * line, `y`, `YES` — leaves the worktree untouched. The tests assert on the
 * *worktree*, not on what the pane printed, because a pane that says it
 * cancelled while having already run `git checkout --` is exactly the bug the
 * gate exists to prevent.
 *
 * **The terminal is borrowed and must be handed back.** The pane takes raw
 * mode, drops it to ask a question, retakes it, and restores what it found on
 * the way out. A pane that leaves raw mode on strands the operator's shell.
 *
 * **Every run is bounded.** The loop reads from stdin until `q`; a test that
 * forgot to send it would hang the suite rather than fail it, so every run here
 * ends with a quit key and a deadline.
 *
 * A real `git` binary and a real temporary repository are used deliberately.
 * The pane's whole job is to report and change what git says, and a faked git
 * would let the pane and the fake agree with each other while both being wrong.
