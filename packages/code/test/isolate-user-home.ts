/**
 * Give every test worker a throwaway HOME.
 *
 * The root's `test/setup/isolate-hobo-home.ts` (also in this package's setup)
 * gives each file its own HOBO_HOME, but that only covers code that reads
 * HOBO_HOME. `resolveHoboHome` falls back to `os.homedir()` for an environment
 * with no HOME, and other code here reads `~/.codex`, `~/.claude` or a git
 * config under HOME. Left alone, all of that is the developer's real home, and
 * a suite run left chats, an auth session and evidence in `~/.hobo`.
 *
 * `os.homedir()` returns `process.env.HOME` when it is set, so setting HOME
 * here moves every in-process lookup. The directory is one per worker inside
 * the run's root (`test/real-home-guard.ts` makes and removes it), so state
 * still cannot leak between runs. A child process given an environment with
 * no HOME falls back to the account's home instead; the guard reports that.
 *
 * Git refuses to commit without an identity, and the developer's
 * `~/.gitconfig` is no longer read, so the home carries one of its own. It is
 * the lowest-precedence config: a test that sets `user.name` in its repository
 * still gets that name.
