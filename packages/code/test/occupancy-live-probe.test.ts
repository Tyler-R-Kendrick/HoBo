/**
 * The probe decides whether `hobo status` calls an endpoint `live` or
 * `last-seen:<date>`. A false negative here does not fail loudly — it tells
 * someone their running service is stale.
 *
 * These pin the direction that matters. The load-dependent half of the defect
 * they were written for is deliberately NOT reproduced here: the bug was that
 * the child process's wall-clock budget was `timeoutMs + 250`, which charged
 * Node interpreter startup to a network timeout, and a test that recreated the
 * load would be exactly the kind of clock-measuring test this repo has been
 * removing all day. The measurement lives in the source comment and the commit:
 * 0/40 false negatives idle, 5/40 under CPU load, 0/40 after the fix.
 *
 * A fourth case was written and deleted: "still sees a listening server when
 * the connect timeout is tiny", `listeningByUrl([url], 1)`. It failed, and it
 * was the assertion that was wrong, not the code — the in-child timer fires
 * before a loopback connect completes, so `timeoutMs` really does govern the
 * connect and 1 ms really is too short. Keeping it would have pinned a false
 * claim about loopback latency.
