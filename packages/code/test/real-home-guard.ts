/**
 * Global setup for this package's suite: one root for every throwaway home,
 * and a guard that fails the run when anything was written into a real one.
 *
 * `test/isolate-user-home.ts` and the root's `test/setup/isolate-hobo-home.ts`
 * point HOME and HOBO_HOME at directories inside the root this makes, so an
 * in-process call that omits its home lands there. That cannot reach a child
 * process started with an environment of its own, or a path built from a
 * literal. The guard covers both: before the run it lists what is already in
 * each real HoBo home and starts watching it, and after the run it names
 * whatever changed.
 *
 * The homes it watches are the ones a stray write lands in:
 *  - `/tmp/.hobo` and `<os.tmpdir()>/.hobo`, the old fallbacks for an
 *    environment with no HOME;
 *  - `<HOME>/.hobo` for the HOME this run was started with, and
 *    `<account home>/.hobo` for a child whose environment names no HOME;
 *  - the HOBO_HOME the runner exported, which the isolation replaced.
 *
 * They may already hold a developer's own state, and on a shared machine they
 * may hold evidence of an earlier leak, so the guard compares against what was
 * there when the run started and never requires them to be absent or empty.
 * It walks each home one directory at a time: a directory a live session
 * removed between being listed and being read is listed again if it is back
 * and recorded as gone if not, so one vanished `sandboxes/<runId>` never turns
 * the rest of the home into "new" entries. It still reports any entry that was
 * not there when its first walk passed.
 * A symlink to a directory is walked through, once, and never back into the
 * home or up to an ancestor of it (`real-home-snapshot.ts`).
 * It reports entries that appeared, entries that were removed, and entries
 * that changed: another kind, inode or mode, a symlink's new target, or a
 * file's size, mtime or ctime (so an overwrite that put the bytes and mtime
 * back is still seen; a directory's own times move with its entries, so only
 * those are compared). It also watches each home for the whole run
 * (`real-home-watch.ts`) and reports a path written there that the snapshot
 * after the run cannot show, such as a file written and removed again. It
 * cannot tell who wrote an entry, so a HoBo session, or
 * another checkout's suite without this isolation, writing there during the
 * run fails it too; the chat and session files it names carry the `cwd` of
 * the process that wrote them.
 *
 * The account's home and the runner's real HOME are watched whatever
 * HOBO_HOME says, and so is the HOBO_HOME the runner exported: every test file
 * gets a throwaway home in its place (`test/setup/isolate-hobo-home.ts`),
 * whether it was `$HOME/.hobo`, as the product's docs suggest, or
 * `$HOME/.local/state/hobo`, and a write into the replaced one still fails
 * the run. `HOBO_TEST_HOBO_HOME` is the deliberate way to run against a real
 * home, and the guard reports what that run wrote there.
