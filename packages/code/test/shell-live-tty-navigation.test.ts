/**
 * The shell's terminal navigation keys, driven through a fake terminal.
 *
 * `shell-live-tty.test.ts` establishes that raw stdin reaches the reducer and
 * that teardown restores the terminal. This drives the other half of the same
 * listener: the keys that move around the shell rather than typing into it.
 *
 * That listener is deliberately layered, and the layering is the behaviour:
 *
 * **The editor owns editing keys; the shell claims only true globals.** If the
 * shell grabbed a key the editor needed, a user could not type it — so the
 * shell's own bindings are conditioned on the editor not wanting them, which is
 * why almost every one of them checks that the input line is empty first.
 *
 * **A modal consumes every key.** While an approval gate is up, nothing may
 * fall through to the editor: a mutation must not be approved by a keystroke
 * aimed at something else. The `/agents` modal pins input for the same reason,
 * Tab included — letting Tab through to focus cycling used to wipe the catalog.
 *
 * **Navigation must never crash the loop.** A key pressed in a state that has
 * nothing to scroll is an ordinary thing for a user to do; it has to be a
 * no-op, not an exception inside a raw-mode terminal that then cannot restore
 * itself.
 *
 * Every run is bounded by `maxMs`, because a live-TTY test that waits on stdin
 * forever hangs the suite instead of failing it.
