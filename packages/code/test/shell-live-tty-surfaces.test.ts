/**
 * The shell's live-TTY *surfaces* — the panels, palettes and modes a user
 * reaches with the keyboard once the loop is running.
 *
 * The companion `shell-live-tty.test.ts` covers entering and leaving the
 * terminal: raw mode, the alternate screen, teardown. This file covers what
 * happens in between, and it exists for the same structural reason — the
 * scripted-keys hook turns the live path *off*
 * (`liveTty = isTty && options.scriptedKeys === undefined`), so none of this
 * runs under a scripted test no matter how many keys it sends.
 *
 * Two things shape every case here:
 *
 * **Every run is bounded.** A live-TTY test that waits on stdin forever hangs
 * the suite instead of failing it, and a hung suite says nothing about which
 * case broke. So every run carries `maxMs`, and every one ends with a quit key.
 *
 * **The terminal must come back clean from every one of these paths.** A mode
 * that swallows Ctrl-C, or a panel that exits without leaving the alternate
 * screen, strands the user's terminal — so the exit assertions repeat across
 * the surfaces rather than being factored into one happy-path test. That
 * repetition is the point: it is the property most likely to break in exactly
 * one mode and go unnoticed.
