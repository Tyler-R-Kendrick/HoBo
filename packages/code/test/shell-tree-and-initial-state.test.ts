/**
 * The two pure functions the whole shell is built out of.
 *
 * `createInitialShellState` decides what the first frame contains before the
 * user has done anything, and `buildShellTree` picks which surface that frame
 * shows. Both are exported and pure, which is what makes the rest of the shell
 * testable — every reducer test in this directory starts from one and every
 * render ends at the other.
 *
 * **`buildShellTree` is a priority ladder, and the order is the contract.**
 * Transcript mode wins, then a pending approval, then the slash palette, then
 * the agents surfaces, then status and resources, then chat. Each rung exists
 * because the one below it would otherwise hide something modal: an approval
 * that lost to the chat pane would be a gate the user cannot see but is still
 * answering, and a palette that lost to the agents pane would leave the user
 * typing a filter into an invisible list.
 *
 * **Every surface says where it is scrolled to.** The title carries `↑N` once
 * the pane is scrolled back, because a scrolled pane and a short pane look
 * identical otherwise — the user cannot tell "there is more above" from "that
 * is all of it".
 *
 * **`createInitialShellState` clamps the terminal size.** A width of 0 comes
 * from a terminal that has not reported yet, and every layout calculation
 * downstream divides or subtracts by it.
