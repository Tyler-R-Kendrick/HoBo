// implements and emitting a portable binding is the designed direction of
// dependency, not a layering breach. Registering them as contracts is what

	// measured rather than argued:
	//
	// 1. The alternative is unworkable. Registered only in
	//    `KNOWN_PACKAGE_PATHS`, each lands at layer 3, and the re-export wiring
	//    the decomposition requires — `@hobo/capability-profiles` re-exporting
	//    the capability and request shapes so no consumer changes — becomes a
	//    layer-1 package importing a layer-3 one. Measured:
	//    `dependency points outward: packages/capability-profiles -> <layer-3>`.
	//    Classifying them any other way would force a fresh allowlist entry for
	//    a package whose entire purpose is to be depended upon.
	// 2. It is the same case the set already exists for. These are
	//    provider-neutral record shapes with no behaviour, mechanically
	//    constrained to `@hobo/core` as their only workspace dependency, which
	//    the outward rule keeps honest: a manifest package that grows a
	//    dependency on an adapter or an app package fails this gate at layer 1
	//    before anyone can lean on it.
	//
	// The widening this *does* buy is deliberate: a provider that needs
	// `ResourcePlan` today has to import `@hobo/cloud`, a layer-3 app package —
	// which is why `pack-framework->packages/cloud` sits in the banked list
