/**
 * The anonymous/claimable conformance dimension.
 *
 * Every other suite in this package asks "does this adapter implement the port
 * correctly". These four ask a different question: **is the product's story
 * about ownership true**. A product that advertises anonymous bootstrap and a
 * one-click claim is making a claim about who holds authority over a resource
 * at each instant, and that claim is only worth anything if it was executed
 * against the real provider and written down.
 *
 * The cases are pure data. Everything effectful — network, clock, randomness,
 * environment, filesystem — arrives through an injected executor port, so the
 * mandatory lane replays offline and deterministically and the live lane is the
 * same data driven by a real adapter.
