/**
 * C1 — the tripwire the banked-list reduction was accused of removing.
 *
 * `ACCEPTED_ADAPTER_PACKAGE_EDGES` went from 31 entries to 14. The seventeen
 * that went all named a target `CONTRACT_PACKAGE_PATHS` classifies as
 * `contract`, which the adapter rule exempts outright, so no verdict changed.
 *
 * The adversarial reading was that they were also documentation and a second
 * line of defence: reclassify one package and seventeen provider edges become
 * violations at once, with nothing on record saying they were ever considered
 * fine.
 *
 * Half of that is right and half of it is backwards, and the half that is
 * backwards decides what to do about it. Measured, by removing
 * `packages/bindings` from `CONTRACT_PACKAGE_PATHS` and running the real
 * workspace graph through `validateBoundaryImports` twice:
 *
 *   with the seventeen deleted (today):  18 bindings violations
 *   with the seventeen restored:          6 bindings violations
 *
 * The allowlist does not warn about a reclassification, it *absorbs* one. Each
 * restored entry names an exact edge and exempts it from both the adapter rule
 * and the outward rule, so twelve of the eighteen go quiet — the six that
 * survive are the `packages/packs/*` reaches, which were never on the list.
 * Restoring the entries would buy a partial silence, not a second line of
 * defence.
 *
 * Two inherited claims also need correcting. "Seventeen provider edges become
 * violations at once" describes no single edit: the seventeen span four
 * targets, and reclassifying any one of them surfaces only its own share (six
 * edges for `bindings`). And the surviving concern is not safety but
 * diagnosability — loud violations with no written record of why the edges were
 * ever acceptable.
 *
 * So this pins the *reason* rather than restoring the list. Each edge below is
 * asserted permitted, and asserted permitted *because its target is contract
 * vocabulary*. Reclassify a package and this fails by name, naming the edge and
 * carrying the explanation, before anyone reaches the anonymous rule violations
 * elsewhere.
