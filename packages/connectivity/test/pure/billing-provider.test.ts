/**
 * The invoice ledger and the two billing providers.
 *
 * This is money-adjacent code, so the properties that matter are the ones that
 * decide whether a tenant is charged once, twice, or not at all.
 *
 * **The ledger is written before the charge, not after.** A crash between the
 * two leaves a recorded invoice with no payment — recoverable. The other order
 * leaves a payment nobody has a record of.
 *
 * **The idempotency key is the invoice id.** A retried charge for the same
 * invoice must reach Stripe as the same request, or a network timeout on a
 * successful call turns into a double charge. That is why it is derived from
 * the invoice rather than generated per attempt.
 *
 * **Amounts are minor units, floored and clamped at zero.** Stripe rejects a
 * fractional amount and a negative one is a refund, which is not what this path
 * is for; a rounding rule that could go either way is a cent of drift per
 * invoice, forever.
 *
 * **A failed charge is a returned status, not a thrown error** — the invoice is
 * already on the ledger, so the caller needs the failure as data it can retry
 * against, not an exception that discards the context. `ensureCustomer` throws,
 * because there is no invoice to attach a failure to yet.
