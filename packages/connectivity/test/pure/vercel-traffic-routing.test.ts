/**
 * The Vercel traffic-routing adapter's refusals and mode selection.
 *
 * Every dependency is injectable — `token`, `fetchImpl`, `metering` — so the
 * whole surface is reachable without a Vercel account.
 *
 * The interesting behaviour is all refusal. This adapter can realize a routing
 * plan two ways, and it declines rather than guessing when neither fits:
 *
 * **A plan id may not be reused for different content.** Re-applying the same
 * id with a different plan would silently replace live routing with something
 * the operator did not diff. It is refused with a named reason instead — and
 * the *same* content under the same id is fine, because a retry after a timeout
 * has to be safe.
 *
 * **Missing credentials deny before anything is sent.** A request that would
 * certainly 401 is not worth making, and the denial says which input is
 * missing rather than reporting an API error.
 *
 * **An unrealizable plan is declined, not approximated.** Vercel's Rolling
 * Releases need exactly two backends under one static rule; a plan that does
 * not fit either that or a rewrites shape gets `mode` as its reason. Half-
 * applying it would leave traffic split in a way nobody asked for.
