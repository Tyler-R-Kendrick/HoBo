 * One test per member under test; the cases are data in a `.cases.jsonl`.

 * Replaces the `describe`-per-function / `it`-per-case shape, where the same
 * arrange-act-assert lines are copied into every case and the boilerplate is
 * where the interesting detail hides. A case is a line here, so adding one is a
 * one-line diff and the assertion logic exists once.
 *
 * It also closes a gap a hand-written suite cannot: the subject's callable
 * surface is read at runtime and a member with no cases **fails the suite**, so
 * a new method is red rather than a silent hole. Deliberate exemptions must be
 * named with a reason, and an exemption that no longer applies also fails.
