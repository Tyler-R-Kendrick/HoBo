# @hobo/core

Shared kernel for HoBo production packages: the event envelope (`EventEnvelope`, with
CloudEvents conversion via `toCloudEvent`/`fromCloudEvent`), capability grants and
enforcement (`parseCapabilityGrant`, `evaluateCapabilityGrants`, `inferCapabilityUsage`),
the capability-manifest bundle parser, a minimal port container (`createContainer`), and
the typed **port contracts** other packages implement: `EventStore`, `Queue`, `Streamer`,
`VirtualClock`, `ComponentHostPort`, `WrpcLinkPort`, `BindingResolverPort`, and
`TrainingEnginePort`.
`TrafficRoutingPort` adds provider-neutral, tenant-scoped multi-backend routing
intent with explicit `full | partial | none` realization and capability notes.

## Honest scope

Implemented: parsers, derived record constructors, error taxonomies, the port
type contracts, the deterministic-clock/queue/streamer value helpers, and the
public-API surface guard (`assertCoreApiSnapshot` against `CORE_API_SNAPSHOT`).
Deliberately not here: no port has a production backend in this package — the
`EventStore`, `Queue`, `Streamer`, and host ports are interfaces plus parse
helpers; implementations live in runtime/provider packages. No I/O, no network,
no persistence.

### HONEST SCOPE — deployment phases and schema diff

`ports/phase.ts` (ADR-0158) ships **vocabulary, parse boundaries, and the
`assertCapabilityPhase` enforcement primitive only**. There is no handler
pipeline and no `ctx.bindings` here: nothing in this package intercepts a
capability access, so enforcement happens where a host calls
`assertCapabilityPhase` — a host that never calls it is never protected.

`ports/schema-diff.ts` (ADR-0160) owns the canonical schema IR and the
forward-only expand/backfill/contract differ. What it deliberately does **not**
do: it emits **no SQL** (`CANONICAL_SCHEMA_DIFF_ENGINE` has no `emitSql`; SQL
emission belongs to toolchain adapters such as `@hobo/adapter-drizzle`, which
fail closed when the toolchain is missing); it models **postgres only** and
refuses any other `dialect` rather than pretending to model it; it models
tables, columns and indexes, so foreign keys, check constraints, enums,
sequences, partitions, views, triggers, and column ordinal position are **not**
represented and a schema that relies on them is under-described rather than
mis-described; the type-widening lattice is a small documented set
(`smallint→integer→bigint→numeric`, `real→double precision`,
`char→varchar→text`, plus parameter growth like `varchar(32)→varchar(64)`) and
every conversion outside it is classified as a **narrowing** — conservative on
purpose, because calling an unknown conversion safe is how an expand phase
loses data. Redefining an index in place (same name, different columns or
uniqueness) yields both an `expand` add and a `contract` drop of that name; the
differ does not model index renames, so distinct names are expected.

## Parse, don't validate

Untrusted input crosses named parser boundaries and becomes frozen derived types:
`parseEventEnvelope` → `EventEnvelope`, `parseCapabilityGrant` → `CapabilityGrant`,
`parseCapabilityManifestBundle` → `CapabilityManifestBundle`, plus branded ids like
`ResourceId`, `QueueName`, `TrajectoryId`, and `WireVersion` from their `parse*`
functions. Failures throw typed errors (`EnvelopeParseError`, `CapabilityParseError`,
`QueueParseError`, …) — parse, don't validate. Wire forms live in `data-models/*.proto`
with CUE constraints alongside.

The deployment-phase and schema-diff ports follow the same boundary:
`parseDeploymentPhase` / `parsePhaseScope` / `parsePhaseScopeFromEnv` →
`DeploymentPhase` and `PhaseScope` (an unknown `HOBO_PHASE` or `HOBO_DEV` value
is refused, never defaulted), and `parseSchemaIr` → a deeply frozen,
name-sorted `SchemaIr` whose derived types `diffSchemaIr` turns into a
`MigrationPlan` — a pure, deterministic, forward-only expand/backfill/contract
plan whose `digest` covers the engine id and version, so an engine upgrade is a
visible plan change. Refusals carry `SchemaIrParseError` /
`PhaseParseError` codes; a phase-scoped capability touched outside its phase
raises `PhaseViolationError` with `code: "PHASE_VIOLATION"`.

Traffic routing follows the same boundary: `parseRoutingPlan` produces a deeply
frozen `RoutingPlan` with branded plan/backend/Station identifiers, while
`TrafficRoutingParseError` rejects malformed plans before adapters see them.
`parseTrafficRoutingPlanRecord` and `toTrafficRoutingPlanRecord` reconcile the
generated protobuf record/JSON enums with that frozen domain view; protobuf's
absent scalar/list defaults normalize optional `degraded`/`notes` to `false`/`[]`.

## Where a user's HoBo state lives (`@hobo/core/hobo-home`)

`resolveHoboHome(env)` is the one rule every package uses for the user-level
state directory (auth sessions, evidence, chats, stations, downloaded tools):
`HOBO_HOME` when it is set and non-empty, else `.hobo` under `HOME` from the
given environment, else under `os.homedir()`. It never falls back to a temp
directory: `/tmp` is world-writable, so another local user could create
`/tmp/.hobo` first and receive what HoBo writes there. It is a Node-only
subpath (it reads `os.homedir()`) and touches no file. When the environment sets
neither variable and the account has no home (a uid with no passwd entry, where
`os.homedir()` throws), it throws `HoboHomeUnavailable`
(`code: "HOBO_HOME_UNAVAILABLE"`), whose message says to set `HOBO_HOME` or
`HOME`; CLI project discovery catches it and skips its home exclusion.

`prepareHoboHome()` is what the `hobo` and `hobo-code` entry points call before
they write. It creates the home (mode 0700), and a home that cannot be created
(the account `nobody`, whose home is `/nonexistent`) fails with
`HoboHomeUnavailable` naming the path and telling the user to set `HOBO_HOME`.
Earlier versions kept state in `/tmp/.hobo` or `$(os.tmpdir())/.hobo` when HOME
was unset. That state is never read now. When such a directory exists, is
owned by the current uid, is not a symlink, is not the resolved home, and
`HOBO_HOME` is unset, the entry point prints a one-time stderr notice saying
where state lives now and how to move it or point `HOBO_HOME` at it. The
dotfile `.legacy-home-notice` in the new home records that it was shown.

## Position in the event architecture

`@hobo/core` defines the vocabulary of the event architecture — envelopes, principal
refs, and the `EventStore`/`Queue`/`Streamer` port contracts — but hosts no actor,
appends nothing to any event store, and maintains no projection or read store itself.
Commands, events, actors, and materialized views are owned by the packages that
implement or consume these ports; this package only guarantees their records parse.
