# @hobo/core

Shared kernel for HoBo production packages: the event envelope (`EventEnvelope`, with
CloudEvents conversion via `toCloudEvent`/`fromCloudEvent`), capability grants and
enforcement (`parseCapabilityGrant`, `evaluateCapabilityGrants`, `inferCapabilityUsage`),
the capability-manifest bundle parser, a minimal port container (`createContainer`), and
the typed **port contracts** other packages implement: `EventStore`, `Queue`, `Streamer`,
`VirtualClock`, `ComponentHostPort`, `WrpcLinkPort`, `BindingResolverPort`, and
`TrainingEnginePort`.
`TrafficRoutingPort` adds provider-neutral, tenant-scoped multi-backend routing
intent with explicit `full | partial | none` realization and capability notes.

## Honest scope

Implemented: parsers, derived record constructors, error taxonomies, the port
type contracts, the deterministic-clock/queue/streamer value helpers, and the
public-API surface guard (`assertCoreApiSnapshot` against `CORE_API_SNAPSHOT`).
Deliberately not here: no port has a production backend in this package — the
`EventStore`, `Queue`, `Streamer`, and host ports are interfaces plus parse
helpers; implementations live in runtime/provider packages. No I/O, no network,
no persistence.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @hobo/core run build
pnpm --filter @hobo/core run typecheck
pnpm --filter @hobo/core run lint
pnpm --filter @hobo/core run test
pnpm --filter @hobo/core run test:contract:consumer
pnpm --filter @hobo/core run test:contract:provider
```

## Parse, don't validate

Untrusted input crosses named parser boundaries and becomes frozen derived types:
`parseEventEnvelope` → `EventEnvelope`, `parseCapabilityGrant` → `CapabilityGrant`,
`parseCapabilityManifestBundle` → `CapabilityManifestBundle`, plus branded ids like
`ResourceId`, `QueueName`, `TrajectoryId`, and `WireVersion` from their `parse*`
functions. Failures throw typed errors (`EnvelopeParseError`, `CapabilityParseError`,
`QueueParseError`, …) — parse, don't validate. Wire forms live in `data-models/*.proto`
with CUE constraints alongside.

Traffic routing follows the same boundary: `parseRoutingPlan` produces a deeply
frozen `RoutingPlan` with branded plan/backend/Station identifiers, while
`TrafficRoutingParseError` rejects malformed plans before adapters see them.
`parseTrafficRoutingPlanRecord` and `toTrafficRoutingPlanRecord` reconcile the
generated protobuf record/JSON enums with that frozen domain view; protobuf's
absent scalar/list defaults normalize optional `degraded`/`notes` to `false`/`[]`.

## Position in the event architecture

`@hobo/core` defines the vocabulary of the event architecture — envelopes, principal
refs, and the `EventStore`/`Queue`/`Streamer` port contracts — but hosts no actor,
appends nothing to any event store, and maintains no projection or read store itself.
Commands, events, actors, and materialized views are owned by the packages that
implement or consume these ports; this package only guarantees their records parse.
