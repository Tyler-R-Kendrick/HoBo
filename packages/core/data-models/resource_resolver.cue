// CUE constraints for every protobuf type in resource_resolver.proto. These
// are load-bearing for the direct-provider-API deployment path: the transport
// URL must be https with no userinfo, no explicit port, and no percent-encoded
// dot segment (each is a way to point a credentialed call at an origin nobody
// allowlisted); every bound is a positive number, since an unbounded call on a
// credentialed connection is an outage waiting for a slow origin; the resolver
// action vocabulary is closed so a caller can tell a create from a duplicate;
// every outcome names a physical id; and credential_ref must match the
// scheme://... locator grammar, so a connection string, bearer token, PEM
// block, or anything with embedded userinfo is refused before it can reach the
// event log, the plan digest, or a diagnostic printed from them.
