/**
 * AWS Signature Version 4 — the deterministic signing primitive.
 *
 * Why this lives in `@hobo/core`: AWS is the one provider on the direct-API
 * deploy path that does not accept a bearer token. Every request to S3,
 * DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, Secrets Manager, and SSM must carry a SigV4
 * `Authorization` header computed over the canonical form of the request. That
 * computation is pure, deterministic cryptography over `node:crypto` with no
 * HoBo domain semantics in it — no Yard, no Bindle, no Camp — so it belongs
 * beside the other ports rather than in a provider adapter (layer 2, which may
 * import `@hobo/core` and nothing else HoBo) or in `@hobo/connectivity`
 * (layer 3, which a provider adapter may not reach). `@hobo/connectivity`
 * re-exports this module under its original names so its Route53 signer keeps
 * working without a second copy of the algorithm.
 *
 * Spec: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html
 *
 * Three details are load-bearing and easy to get subtly wrong — each is
 * pinned by the official `aws-sig-v4-test-suite` vectors in
 * `test/aws-sigv4.test.ts`, because a signer that is subtly wrong fails only
 * against the live API:
 *
 * - **Ordering is by code unit, never by locale.** `localeCompare` puts
 *   `Param1` before `Param2` in every locale a developer is likely to test in
 *   and reorders other pairs in ones they are not. SigV4 specifies a byte
 *   ordering, so this module compares by code unit and a signature is a
 *   function of the request rather than of the machine that signed it.
 * - **URI encoding is RFC 3986, not `encodeURIComponent`.** The platform
 *   function leaves `!'()*` unescaped; AWS requires them percent-encoded, so
 *   the encoder here escapes them explicitly.
 * - **Header names are folded to lower case before collection, not after.**
 *   A caller that passes both `Host` and `host` would otherwise contribute two
 *   canonical `host:` lines and a `host;host` signed-headers list — a
 *   signature the service rejects for a request that looks fine on the wire.
 *
 * Duplicate header values are joined with `,` in the order supplied, which is
 * what the `get-header-key-duplicate` and `get-header-value-order` vectors
 * require; supply them as an array to model a header sent more than once.
 *
 * Path encoding is applied **once**. That matches the published vectors
 * (`get-utf8` expects `/%E1%88%B4`, not `/%25E1%2588%25B4`) and matches S3,
 * which never double-encodes. Services that double-encode their paths are not
 * on HoBo's direct-API path today, and the endpoints that are address either
 * `/` or a single DNS-safe bucket segment, where single and double encoding
 * are identical.
 *
 * Determinism: the only impurity is the signing timestamp, which SigV4
 * genuinely requires. Pass `now` and the output is byte-stable; omit it and
 * the module reads the clock once, which is why every HoBo caller passes it.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: this module proves the signature is computed the way the
 * published vectors say it should be. It does not prove any request was ever
 * sent, accepted, or authorized — that needs real credentials and real network
 * egress, neither of which a unit test supplies.
