/**
 * Camp tiers: the standard segmentation of a workload into units that are
 * secured, deployed, and blast-radius-bounded as one.
 *
 * ## What a tier is, and why it is a Camp rather than a label
 *
 * Azure's Well-Architected SE:04 defines a segment as "a logical section of
 * your solution that needs to be secured as one unit", and names "application
 * tiers that isolate by workload utility" as one of its examples. AWS's
 * SEC05-BP01 says the same thing from the network side: "Segment your network
 * topology into different layers based on logical groupings of your workload
 * components according to their data sensitivity and access requirements."
 *
 * A Camp is HoBo's deployment target — the thing a Bindle is placed into and
 * the thing controls attach to. So a tier *is* a Camp, not a label on one. If
 * tier were a label, every tier would share a placement target, which is
 * exactly the anti-pattern SEC05-BP01 names first: "You create all resources in
 * a single VPC or subnet."
 *
 * ## The three grouping criteria, taken from SEC05-BP01
 *
 * A component belongs in a tier by:
 *
 * 1. **Function** — what responsibility it serves ("presentation layer,
 *    application layer, and data layer").
 * 2. **Data sensitivity** — "different services may process data with different
 *    sensitivity levels", which can justify splitting one functional tier.
 * 3. **Behaviour** — services taking "inherently riskier" input ("file uploads,
 *    code scripts to run, email scanning") get their own boundary so their
 *    behaviour cannot mask or trip inspection on the rest.
 *
 * Criterion 3 is why {@link CAMP_TIERS.untrusted} exists as a named tier rather
 * than being folded into `app`.
 *
 * ## Why only three are default
 *
 * SE:04 records the countervailing risk in as many words: "Micro-segmentation
 * beyond a reasonable limit loses the benefit of isolation. When you create too
 * many segments, it becomes difficult to identify points of communication or to
 * allow for valid communication paths within the segment." It also names a cost
 * tradeoff, since side-by-side segments provision more resources.
 *
 * So {@link DEFAULT_CAMP_TIERS} is the three-tier shape both frameworks reach
 * for by default, and `untrusted` / `ops` are standard-but-opt-in: available by
 * name, applied when the workload actually earns them.
 *
 * ## Tiers are segments, not trust boundaries
 *
 * HoBo's posture is zero-trust with "no ambient trust, no implicit network
 * perimeter" (ADR-0023), which at first reading sits badly with a tier called
 * `edge`. Both frameworks resolve it the same way and so does this module.
 * SE:04: "Identity perimeters are network agnostic while network perimeters
 * augment identity but never replace it." AWS SEC05 opens by saying components
 * are "considered discrete from each other and no component or microservice
 * trusts any other."
 *
 * A tier therefore buys **containment**, not trust. Being in `app` never means a
 * caller skips authentication; it means a breach in `edge` does not
 * automatically reach `data`. Anything that treated tier membership as a reason
 * to relax authn/authz would contradict ADR-0023 and is out of scope for this
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT a tier
 *
 * **Availability clusters.** Fault isolation across zones, regions, and cells is
 * AWS REL10 ("Use fault isolation to protect your workload": deploy to multiple
 * locations, bulkhead architectures). That is a placement-and-redundancy axis,
 * and in HoBo a Yard already carries `regions`. Modelling it as a tier would
 * multiply Camps by zone count — three tiers across three zones is nine Camps
 * describing three segments — and land squarely in SE:04's over-segmentation
 * risk. Availability belongs on the Yard.
 *
 * **Environments.** `production` / `staging` / `ephemeral` / `development` are a
 * separate axis (`ENV_TYPES`), and SE:04 lists them separately too: "Deployment
 * environments that isolate deployment by stages." Tier and environment are
 * orthogonal — a production `data` Camp and a staging `data` Camp are both real
 * and both needed.

	 *
	 * HoBo has a second, harder reason: ADR-0024 makes a microVM the
