/**
 * The typed capability vocabulary: every capability profile an author may name,
 * keyed by the slot that holds it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A capability profile id is a string with real grammar — `<family>.<path>/v<major>`
 * (ADR-0151) — and until now every authoring site spelled one by hand. That made
 * three distinct failures possible, all of them only catchable at runtime:
 *
 * 1. A typo (`"data.postgress/v1"`) reached `yard()` and refused there, or worse
 *    matched nothing and silently narrowed a Yard's catalog.
 * 2. A profile filed under the wrong slot (`slot: "kv"`, `profile: "data.postgres/v1"`)
 *    refused with `SLOT_PROFILE_MISMATCH` — a real refusal, but one the type
 *    system had every fact needed to prevent.
 * 3. A profile that no registry entry defines looked identical, at the call
 *    site, to one that does.
 *
 * Naming a profile through {@link capability} makes all three a compile error.
 * `capability.data.postgres` cannot be misspelled, and {@link ProfileForSlot}
 * makes `slot: "kv"` reject a `data.*` profile before anything runs.
 *
 * ## Sub-capabilities are the point, not a detail
 *
 * A slot is a *kind of thing* (`data`); a profile is *which kind of that thing*
 * (`data.postgres`). The second half is what portability actually turns on: an
 * app that needs Postgres wire protocol and an app that needs "any SQL database"
 * are asking different questions, and a Yard that offers D1 answers only the
 * second. That distinction lives in the refinement graph
 * (`@hobo/capability-profiles`), where `data.postgres/v1` refines
 * `data.relational/v1` — satisfying the child satisfies the parent, never the
 * reverse. This module is the typed *names*; that registry is the *meaning*.
 *
 * ## Duplication, and the guard that makes it safe
 *
 * `@hobo/core` is layer 0 and cannot import `@hobo/capability-profiles`, so this
 * list is necessarily a second copy of the ids that registry defines. That is a
 * drift risk and it is guarded rather than hoped about:
 * `packages/capability-profiles/test/catalog-drift.test.ts` asserts this
 * catalog and the standard profile registry name exactly the same ids, in both
 * directions. Adding a profile to one and not the other fails that test.
 *
 * Provider packages may register additional profiles at runtime; those are not
 * listed here, and naming one is still allowed through the untyped `profile`
 * field. This catalog types the *first-party* vocabulary, it does not close it.
 */

 * distinguishing leaf (`pgvector`) rather than nesting objects, because a key
 * cannot be both a string and a namespace.
