/**
 * Codec for the published `/.well-known/capability-manifest/*` documents.
 *
 * Eight provider packages each carried their own byte-identical copy of this:
 * the same canonical-JSON writer, the same digest walk, and in four cases the
 * same parser. They belong here because the schema ids below are *platform*
 * contract, not any one provider's concern — a provider that spells
 * `hobo.capabilities/v1` differently is broken, not customised.
 *
 * `canonicalJson` was moved verbatim and must stay that way: its output is what
 * every digest is computed over, so a "tidier" rewrite that reorders a key or
 * drops the trailing newline changes every digest silently.
 *
 * `stableDigest` was **not** kept as-is, and the reasoning is worth recording
 * because the previous comment here argued the opposite. It used to be a 32-bit
 * FNV-ish walk emitting `fnv:` + 8 hex digits, described as "not a security
 * primitive". That description was accurate and that was the problem: these
 * documents are fetched from a **provider-controlled origin**, so a
 * document-integrity reference an attacker can collide by brute force in
 * milliseconds is not integrity, it is a typo detector. Three runner packages
 * had already reached the same conclusion independently and used SHA-256.
 *
 * The reason given for keeping FNV — that changing it would invalidate
 * published references — did not survive being checked. Nothing in the repo
 * verifies these values (`runner-github` checks only that the field is a
 * non-empty string), and no manifest has ever been published from here to a
 * live provider. The cost of converging was zero and the cost of not
 * converging was two algorithms behind one name.
