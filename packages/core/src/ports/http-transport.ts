/**
 * The credentialed HTTPS boundary every provider resolver runs over.
 *
 * HoBo's default deployment path talks to provider REST APIs directly — no IaC
 * engine sits in the middle — so this is the single place a deploy leaves the
 * process. Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`: a host supplies an
 * `HttpTransport`, and `guardTransport` is what makes any supplied transport
 * safe to hand a credential. The request headers on this path carry the
 * sponsoring provider token, so a driver that trusts its transport can be
 * pointed at an attacker's origin by one bad config value.
 *
 * The guard generalizes the hardened Vercel boundary: HTTPS only, allowlisted
 * hosts — exact by default, optionally plus a dot-anchored parent domain for a
 * provider whose per-tenant origin is minted at deploy time — allowlisted path
 * prefixes, no redirect chasing, bounded body, bounded time. Every violation is
 * a `TransportGuardError` carrying its own code — the guard never clamps, never
 * falls back, and never silently downgrades a request into a weaker one,
 * because a downgrade that still reaches the network has already spent the
 * credential.
 *
 * Two normalization rules are deliberate and load-bearing:
 *
 * - Host comparison is **exact** against the policy strings. WHATWG URL
 *   parsing already lowercases an ASCII authority and punycodes a non-ASCII
 *   one, so `https://API.Example.com` and `https://api.example.com` are the
 *   same host and both match an `api.example.com` entry. What the guard will
 *   not do is case-fold the *policy*: a mixed-case allowlist entry matches
 *   nothing. Repairing a policy typo is widening reach on a guess, and this
 *   guard fails closed instead.
 * - Percent-encoded path separators are refused rather than decoded. Be precise
 *   about which forms actually survive, because the obvious example does not:
 *   WHATWG resolves dot segments during parsing, and it treats `%2e` as a dot
 *   while doing so, so `/v1/../admin` *and* `/v1/%2e%2e/admin` both arrive at
 *   the prefix check already collapsed to `/admin` — and are refused by the
 *   prefix check on their own merits.
 *
 *   What survives is an encoded *separator*: `%2f` and `%5c` are not separators
 *   to the parser, so `/v1/projects/%2f%2e%2e%2fadmin` and
 *   `/v1/projects/..%5cadmin` reach the prefix check with the prefix intact,
 *   pass it, and are decoded only by the origin — after every check here. Their
 *   presence is the refusal. `%2e` stays in the pattern because it still
 *   appears in those composite forms.
 *
 * Purity: no clock, no randomness, no ambient environment reads. The guard is
 * a pure function of the request, the policy, and the inner transport's reply.

 *   (`:6443`, or `:8001` through `kubectl proxy`). `assertAllowedEndpoint`
 *   refuses a non-443 port before it ever consults a host rule. Giving it an
 *   `allowAnyHost` and an `allowedPorts` escape would delete the two checks
 *   this guard exists for, for the benefit of one caller.
 * - `provider-browser-wasm` fetches WebAssembly, so its response body is a
 *   `Uint8Array`. `TransportResponse.body` here is a `string`, and routing
 *   bundle bytes through it corrupts them: `0xff 0xfe 0x80` decodes to three
 *   U+FFFD and re-encodes as nine bytes, which is also what the byte cap would
 *   then be measuring.
 *
 * `provider-upstash` was the third and is no longer: `allowedHostSuffixes`
 * expresses its data plane, and its URL check now runs here. Its response half
 * stays local because it clamps an over-asking caller down to the policy where
 * this guard refuses — a difference its own suite pins.
