/**
 * Deployment phases (ADR-0158): the shared vocabulary plus the enforcement
 * primitives that make "when may I touch this?" a parse-time answer instead of
 * a runtime surprise.
 *
 * A deployment moves through three phases — `plan` (build the desired graph,
 * no live resources), `init` (module top-level: bindings are wired, clients are
 * constructed once per instance) and `handle` (per-request work). Touching a
 * request-scoped capability during `init` is the classic host bug: it captures
 * one request's state into instance state and leaks it across every subsequent
 * request. Touching an init-scoped capability during `handle` is the mirror
 * bug: per-request client construction on the hot path. Both are refused here
 * with a typed `PhaseViolationError` naming the capability and the phase it
 * belongs to.
 *
 * Dev is a MODE, not a phase (ADR-0158 §2): `hobo dev` runs phase `plan` then
 * `init` with `dev: true`. Modelling dev as a fourth phase would let a dev-only
 * affordance masquerade as a phase-legal one. `dev` therefore rides alongside
 * the phase and never changes which capabilities a phase admits.
 *
 * This module ships vocabulary + enforcement + parse boundaries only. It does
 * NOT ship a handler pipeline: `@hobo/runtime` has no handler surface today and
 * inventing one here would be an overclaim (design-review correction 6).
