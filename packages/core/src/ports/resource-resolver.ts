/**
 * The contract every provider resource resolver implements.
 *
 * HoBo's default deployment path calls provider REST APIs directly: there is
 * no IaC engine holding a state file and no plan/apply round trip. What
 * replaces it is this — one convergent `reconcile` per product, handed an
 * already-guarded `HttpTransport`. The resolver is the only thing that knows
 * a provider's wire shape; everything above it sees `ResolveRequest` in and
 * `ResolveOutcome` out.
 *
 * `reconcile` is required to be convergent and idempotent. Running it twice
 * against the same desired state must yield the same outcome and exactly one
 * resource, which is why the outcome names an `action` rather than a bare
 * success: a caller that cannot tell `create` from `noop` cannot tell a
 * working deploy from a duplicate one. `adopt` is the honest name for finding
 * a pre-existing resource that matches, and `read` is what makes adoption and
 * state recovery possible without a state file.
 *
 * The hard law here is that **the app never holds credential material**.
 * `credentialRef` is a locator — `scheme://…` — resolved by the host at the
 * moment of the call, never a connection string, bearer token, or PEM.
 * `parseResolveRequest` refuses anything value-shaped with
 * `RESOLVER_CREDENTIAL_NOT_A_REF`, because a secret that reaches this record
 * reaches the event log, the plan digest, and every diagnostic printed from
 * them. The same screen runs over `desired`, `observed`, and `outputs`: a
 * credential-shaped key in a property bag is exactly as leaked as one in the
 * ref field.
 *
 * Determinism: parsed records are deep-frozen with property keys sorted by
 * code unit, and `createResolverRegistry` lists id-sorted rather than in
 * registration order, so a catalog dump is a function of its contents and not
 * of import order. No clock, no randomness, no ambient environment reads.
