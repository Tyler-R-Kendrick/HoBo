/**
 * `postgres.database({ ... })` — the Bindle-facing authoring surface.

 * The failure this file guards against is not a crash. It is a Bindle that
 * *looks* portable and is not: a requirement that silently dropped a feature
 * the application depends on, or that let a provider name in through an option

 * misbehaves later, so every assertion below states which of the two it stops.
