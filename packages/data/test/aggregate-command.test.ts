/**
 * Running a command through an aggregate's single-writer boundary.
 *
 * `execute` is the write path for every event-sourced aggregate in the system.
 * Its shape is unusual in a way that makes several properties easy to break and
 * hard to notice:
 *
 * - **The lease is released in a `finally`, and the passivation fact is pushed
 *   there too.** So the lifecycle trail is emitted on *every* exit, including
 *   the failing ones. A version that only passivated on success would leak the
 *   single-writer lease on the first invariant violation, and every later
 *   command against that stream would block on a holder that had already
 *   returned.
 * - **The no-op path returns before appending.** A command that decides to emit
 *   nothing must not write an empty batch, or every read of a busy aggregate
 *   would advance its sequence.
 * - **Two different store failures become two different aggregate errors.** An
 *   optimistic conflict is retryable by re-reading; a stale fence means another
 *   writer took the lease and this one must not retry at all. Collapsing them
 *   would turn a fencing violation into a retry loop that fights the new
 *   holder.
 *
 * Everything runs against the real runtime-local event store and the real
 * in-memory actor host. Faking either would let the aggregate and the fake agree
 * with each other about sequencing, which is the whole thing under test.
