/**
 * The durable ActorHost — the SQLite-backed lease.
 *
 * A lease is what makes single-writer-per-aggregate true (ADR-0135). Two
 * holders believing they hold the same key at once is the failure this exists
 * to prevent, so what matters is not the happy path but the translation layer:
 * this host owns almost no logic, and the logic it does own is *which journal
 * errors mean somebody else has the key*.
 *
 * **A stale fence is a lease conflict, not a crash.** The journal signals a
 * lost race with `StaleFenceError` / `STALE_FENCE`, and a caller that received
 * that verbatim would have to know the storage layer's error vocabulary to
 * retry correctly. Translating it to `LeaseConflictError` is what lets a caller
 * back off without importing the storage package.
 *
 * **Every other error passes through untouched.** A disk failure dressed up as
 * a lease conflict would send a caller into a retry loop against a database
 * that is not coming back — the one thing worse than surfacing the real error.
 *
 * **The fence token comes from the journal, never from here.** It is the
 * monotonic proof of which holder is current; a host that generated or
 * defaulted one would hand out a token that fences nothing.
 *
 * **Release names the fence it holds.** Releasing by key alone would let a
 * holder whose lease already expired and was reacquired release the *new*
 * holder's lease.
