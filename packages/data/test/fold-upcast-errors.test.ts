/**
 * Three small modules that together decide whether an event stream stays
 * replayable forever.
 *
 * `foldEvents` has one property everything else depends on: a replay must reach
 * the same state as the original live pass. That is why quarantine is persisted
 * as a *fact* carrying the seq it neutralises rather than being decided afresh
 * each time — if the fold re-judged a poison event on every replay, a body that
 * happened to throw once and not the next time would give two different states
 * from the same log.
 *
 * `createUpcasterRegistry` is the other half: old events are never rewritten, so
 * every read walks them forward through a chain of pure transforms. A chain with
 * a gap silently stops upcasting partway and hands the caller a half-migrated
 * body that still claims its old version.
 *
 * The typed errors exist so a caller can tell "your command was illegal, do not
 * retry" from "someone appended first, re-fold and try again" — collapsing those
 * two produces either an infinite retry loop or a dropped write.
