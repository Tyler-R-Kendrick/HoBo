/**
 * The reservation ledger's CAS, headroom accounting and lifecycle invariants
 * (ADR-0071, promoted from the reservation-hardening contract).
 *
 * A reservation is how the dispatcher stops two concurrent dispatches from
 * spending the same free credit twice. Everything here turns on three
 * properties, and each of them fails silently rather than loudly:
 *
 * 1. **Compare-and-swap on `seq`.** A stale `expectedSeq` must be refused, not
 *    applied. If it were applied, two callers who both read the ledger at seq
 *    91 would each reserve against the same headroom and the provider would
 *    bill for the overage.
 * 2. **Headroom consumed on reserve is restored exactly once on release.**
 *    Restoring twice invents free credit that does not exist; restoring zero
 *    times leaks it permanently. The `consumption` record on the reservation
 *    is what makes the restore exact rather than approximate.
 * 3. **Terminal states are terminal.** A confirmed or released reservation
 *    cannot be released again, or its headroom would be restored twice.
