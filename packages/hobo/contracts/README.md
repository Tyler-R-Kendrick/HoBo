# Product CLI contracts

`hobo-composition-boundary.pact.json` pins the existing product composition
boundary. `ci-cli.pact.json` adds the account CI consumer: policy read, bound App
installation discovery, and isolated repository connection with bearer headers,
generated protobuf JSON and the current policy revision in `If-Match`.
`test/ci-command.test.ts` executes every interaction through the real CLI and
exported relay client and checks the complete request sequence. These are
hand-authored consumer expectations, not captured or provider-verified traffic.
The corresponding HTTP provider suite remains in
`../../ci-gh-actions/contracts/hosted-control-boundary.pact.json` and its provider
tests. The CLI adds no new server endpoint or response shape.

`test/ci-runs.test.ts` exercises the process contract to GitHub CLI with exact
argument arrays, repository/host selection, bounded JSON parsing, current commit
resolution, retry admission and new-attempt fencing. It uses a process seam;
live GitHub assignment, logs, and reruns remain release checks.

`e2e/ci.test.ts` additionally exercises the built executable over real HTTPS to
the production hosted control plane and native PostgreSQL journal. Restart and
lost-response cases verify idempotent recovery after a durable commit. GitHub App
identity is emulated; provider assignment remains a separate live acceptance.
The account HTTP client bounds responses to 2 MiB and rejects invalid UTF-8;
its consumer contract covers these failures without logging credentials.

TypeScript protects the command integration. `data-models/composition.proto`
owns the generated persisted CI link; `composition.cue` constrains its HTTPS
origin, account and repository. Checked-in valid/invalid fixtures run through the
package schema gate and reject insecure origins, malformed identities and embedded
credentials. Credentials stay outside the link. Relay writes
continue through the existing durable account/setup commands and projections;
the CLI does not introduce a parallel event journal or read model.
