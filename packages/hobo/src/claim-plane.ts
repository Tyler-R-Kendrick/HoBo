// store `hobo up` writes to.

// from — `reduce` is pure, so replaying commands is deterministic — and the
// emitted events are the published facts every projection and subscriber
// reads. Persisting only the events would leave nothing to rebuild from;
// persisting only the commands would leave subscribers with nothing to watch.
