/**
 * `HOBO_CREDENTIALS=opensesame` (ADR-0170): the composed `hobo` takes its
 * provider credentials from OpenSesame, not from its own environment.
 *
 * The parent `hobo` composes nothing. It reads `hobo.credentials.json`
 * (references only: an OpenSesame connection and the scope a surrogate may
 * reach; never a token), relaunches itself once as
 * `opensesame dev --agent --schema <generated> run -- <this hobo invocation>`
 * through `@hobo/adapter-opensesame`'s `runProxied`, and exits with the run's
 * status: the child's own, a tripwire's 77, a signal's 128+n, or 1 for a run
 * that left placeholders or never started. The child carries
 * `HOBO_OPENSESAME_CHILD=1`, so it composes the CLI instead of relaunching, and
 * holds an `osr_` surrogate in `VERCEL_TOKEN` that only OpenSesame's proxy can
 * redeem, at `api.vercel.com`.
 *
 * In the child, `selectIacProvider` (compose.ts) calls
 * `requireOpenSesameSurrogate` before it picks a lane: a run whose plugin is
 * missing or off exits 0 and hands the child a placeholder, and an emulator
 * that accepts any token would turn that into a false green
 * (`OPENSESAME_PLACEHOLDERS_ONLY`).
