/**
 * The first-party product catalog, composed from the provider packages.
 *
 * Matching cannot select a product nobody registered. Each provider package
 * owns the facts about its own product — profiles, runtimes, claim story,
 * evidence refs — and this module is the one place those declarations are
 * gathered into the catalog the CLI, the offer compiler and the capability
 * matrix all read. It contains no product facts of its own: every entry here
 * is a re-export of a declaration that lives beside the driver that honours it.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - A provider that has not declared a `ResourceDefinitionSemantics` block
 *    contributes nothing. It is listed in {@link CATALOG_GAPS} rather than
 *    quietly omitted, so "we have no Neon coverage yet" reads differently from
 *    "Neon is broken".
 *  - Nothing here decides whether a product is *usable*. Trust evidence,
 *    freshness and conformance are evaluated downstream at a supplied instant;
 *    registration only makes a product visible to that judgement.
