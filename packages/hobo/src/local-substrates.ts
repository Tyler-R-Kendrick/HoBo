/**
 * Local substrate auto-discovery: inspect the machine a default localhost
 * Station is running on and report, per *hosting substrate*, whether this box
 * can actually run a workload that way — then turn the substrates that are
 * present into Yards the Station can register.
 *
 * Today `seedLocalhostYard()` (ADR-0157) gives a localhost Station exactly one
 * Yard, `yard:local`, decided purely from capability observations. That seed is
 * substrate-blind: it does not know whether this machine has a WASM toolchain,
 * a container engine, a WSL2 guest kernel, LXC/Incus, systemd-nspawn, or KVM +
 * Firecracker. This module supplies the missing axis, and keeps three rules
 * that the seed already holds:
 *
 * - **Pure over injected probes.** Detection never reads `process.env`, never
 *   shells out, never touches the network, and never looks at the clock. The
 *   only way in is a `LocalSubstrateProbes` record, so a test can describe a
 *   whole machine as data. A timestamp, if wanted, is an injected `now`.
 * - **Nothing is silently omitted.** Every substrate in the closed vocabulary
 *   appears in the report, absent ones with a remediation naming what to change.
 *   A dropped substrate reads as "HoBo has no opinion here" when the truth is
 *   "this box cannot host that way".
 * - **Evidence or it did not happen.** `present: true` requires at least one
 *   concrete evidence row (a binary path, a socket path, a file inspected). The
 *   invariant is asserted, not merely intended, and a violation is a typed
 *   refusal rather than an optimistic claim.
 *
 * Fidelity (ADR-0042) is assigned honestly and deliberately conservatively: see
 * `SUBSTRATE_BINDINGS` below for why only the process-shaped substrates earn
 * `real`, WASM is `simulated`, and the container/microVM substrates are
 * `camp-only`.

 *   not change what *HoBo* executes, so `real` would be an overclaim.
 * - **oci / lxc / nspawn / firecracker → `camp-only`.** HoBo has no local
 *   launcher that places a workload into a container or microVM on this
 *   machine: `@hobo/runtime-oci` schedules through kubectl against a cluster,
 *   and there is no LXC/nspawn/Firecracker placement path at all. The substrate
 *   is genuinely available on the box, but satisfying the profile needs a Camp,
 *   which is exactly what `camp-only` means.
 *
 * `process` and `wsl2` are absent from this table on purpose: both reuse
 * `seedLocalhostYard()`'s rows, which carry their own already-audited
