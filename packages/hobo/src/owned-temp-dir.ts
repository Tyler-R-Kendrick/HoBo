/**
 * A temporary directory a process makes for itself and removes on every way
 * out a handler can reach. The default runtime keeps its throwaway event store
 * in one (`hobo-yard-*`), and the live Pulumi lane, without HOBO_PULUMI_WORKDIR,
 * its programs and state (`hobo-pulumi-live-*`); both were left in TMPDIR by
 * every run.
 *
 * - `ownedTempDir`, safe in any process: the directory is removed on the `exit`
 *   event, which a normal end and an uncaught error both reach. It touches no
 *   signal: a library does not decide how its host ends.
 * - `removeOwnedDirsOnSignals`, for a process's entry point only (`hobo`,
 *   `hobo-mcp`, and `hobo-code` when a /hobo verb loads the composition, through
 *   the export in cli.ts): also on SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGQUIT. When
 *   nothing else in the process listens for the signal, every owned directory
 *   is removed and the signal raised again with these handlers off, so the
 *   process still ends by it (status 128+n), as it would have. When something
 *   else listens (a server's graceful stop), that handler decides how the
 *   process ends, and `exit` removes the directories then. These handlers run
 *   before any other listener, so they also count one installed before them.
 *   Run after it, they missed a `once` handler, which is removed before it is
 *   called: hobo-code's shell installs its own before a /hobo verb loads the
 *   composition. Each handler knows its own signal: one emitted with
 *   `process.emit` carries no name. It does nothing in a worker thread, which
 *   shares its pid with the whole process.
 *
 * Installed by the library, the signal handlers ended hosts that never asked
 * for them: the hobo suite's serve-control test emits SIGINT to its own
 * handlers, and in a vitest worker thread that composed a default runtime the
 * handler took the emit for a signal and killed the whole runner.
 *
 * What no handler can reach: SIGKILL, and a crash of the process itself.
