// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The direct-HTTP resolver plane, behind the kernel's `IacProvider` port.
//
// `@hobo/cloud`'s Executor drives an injected `IacProvider`. Until now that port
// could only be served by an IaC engine (`createPulumiBackedIacProvider`) or by
// one of the two bespoke deploy providers. The resolver plane
// (`@hobo/core`'s `hobo.resource-resolver/v1`) stood beside that path rather
// than behind it: `cloudflareResolverRegistry()` and `vercelResolverRegistry()`
// were reachable from a test and from nothing else. This module closes that.
//
// The shape mirrors `pulumi-iac-provider.ts` exactly, because the hard problem
// is the same one: `IacProgram` is a thin EXECUTION descriptor
// (programId/deploymentId/resourceId/provider/driver/action/stackName) that
// identifies a resource and carries no desired state. Desired state is recovered
// from the durable `deployment.Planned` fact already on the deployment stream —
// the same content-addressed plan the gateway stored — and never fabricated:
//
//   1. read the stored `DeploymentPlan` for `program.deploymentId`,
//   2. find this resource's real `ResourcePlan` by `program.resourceId`,
//   3. key the resolver lookup on the plan node's `productId` (ADR-0157) and
//      use its `realizationParameters` as `ResolveRequest.desired`,
//   4. call the REAL resolver's `reconcile`/`delete`/`read` over the injected,
//      already-guarded `HttpTransport`.
//
// FAIL CLOSED ON AN UNDECIDED PRODUCT. `productId` and `realizationParameters`
// are populated only when the plan was built with Yard binding authority. On the
// legacy port-only planning path they are ABSENT, and absent means "not decided
// here" — never "any product will do". A node without a `productId` is refused
// with a typed code that names the remediation; the product is NEVER guessed
// from the port or the provider id, which is exactly the naming-convention
// inference ADR-0144 forbids.
//
// PREVIEW NEVER LIES. `IacDiff.changes` is a bare count with no "unknown", so a
// preview that could not look reports {@link RESOLVER_PREVIEW_UNDETERMINED} and
// says so in the summary rather than reporting `0`. A silent "0 changes" from a
// driver that never inspected anything is the single worst failure mode here:
// it reads exactly like a verified no-op.
//
// NO CREDENTIAL MATERIAL. `credentialRef` is a LOCATOR (`scheme://path`); the
// host resolves it to material at call time inside the resolver. Nothing in this
// module holds, logs, or echoes a secret, and nothing here reaches for a global
// `fetch` — the transport is injected. Provider error text is redacted by the
// resolvers themselves (`redactCloudflareText` and the Vercel equivalent), so
// this module re-raises rather than re-implementing redaction.
//
// DETERMINISM: no clock, no randomness, no ambient environment reads in the
// logic below. `createFetchHttpTransport` is the one I/O adapter and is opt-in.
//
// HONEST SCOPE: everything here is proven against an INJECTED FAKE transport.
// This module has never issued a live provider call; a real deploy additionally
// needs real credentials, real network egress, and a real provider account, none
// of which a unit test supplies.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// public-contract: every refusal this deploy driver can report, so a caller can branch on the reason rather than matching on a message.
