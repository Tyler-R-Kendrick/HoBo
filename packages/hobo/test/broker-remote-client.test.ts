/**
 * The remote broker client: construction, the anonymous session, and the
 * error it throws. Placement is in `broker-remote-place.test.ts` and claiming
 * in `broker-remote-claim.test.ts`.
 *
 * Three operations — anonymous session, place, claim — each of which crosses the
 * network and comes back as a *parsed* record rather than a response. The
 * parsing is the point: nothing downstream re-checks a broker's payload, so a
 * field this parser lets through is treated as real for the rest of the deploy.
 * A missing `primaryUrl` accepted as an empty string produces a deployment
 * receipt naming an address nobody can open, discovered by whoever tries.
 *
 * **Discovery is fetched once and cached.** A client that re-discovered per call
 * could be repointed mid-deploy by a changed document, so that place and claim
 * for one deployment went to two different brokers.
