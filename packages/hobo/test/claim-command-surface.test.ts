/**
 * `hobo claim` — binding a deployment to an account without re-provisioning.
 *
 * Claiming is the moment an anonymous deploy stops being temporary. The whole
 * point is that nothing moves: the URL, the resources, and the running
 * workload are preserved, and only ownership changes. `urlPreserved: true` in
 * the remote payload is that promise stated where a consumer can check it.
 *
 * **The remote and local lanes are chosen by what the user supplied, and a
 * half-supplied remote claim is refused rather than silently falling back.**
 * A `--token` with no `--broker` is not a local claim — it is a user who
 * copied half a command, and running the local path for them would either
 * claim the wrong deployment or report "no deployment" for one that exists on
 * a broker.
 *
 * **Claiming twice is a success, not an error.** The ceremony is triggered by
 * a token that may reach the user through a retried script or a re-read
 * terminal. Reporting failure on the second run would make a correct outcome
 * look broken; `already_claimed` says what happened without pretending work
 * was done.
 *
 * **A local claim continues the fenced stream rather than bypassing it.** The
 * deployment stream is fenced by owner epoch. Appending outside the fence
 * would let a stale process overwrite an ownership change it never saw.
