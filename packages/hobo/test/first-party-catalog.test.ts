/**
 * The first-party catalog, and the two shapes providers declare it in.
 *
 * Matching cannot select a product nobody registered, so this module is the
 * gate every first-party product passes through. It holds no product facts of
 * its own — each entry is a re-export of a declaration living beside the driver
 * that honours it — which makes the *adaptation* the thing to test: providers
 * declare in two different shapes and the catalog has to render both into one.
 *
 * **A legacy declaration brings its own port/feature half; a semantics-only one
 * does not.** For the second, the legacy half is derived rather than invented —
 * `features` comes from the boolean structured capabilities the product
 * actually claims. That is what keeps the two matching paths from disagreeing
 * about the same product: `satisfies` answers the legacy port/feature question
 * using the same facts profile matching reads. A derived feature list that
 * drifted from the semantics would let a product pass one path and fail the
 * other.
 *
 * **Order is load-bearing.** The catalog is sorted by id so its digest — and
 * every signed resolution receipt that pins it — is independent of import
 * order. A catalog that reordered when someone moved an import line would
 * invalidate receipts without any product changing.
 *
 * **Cost is a claim about money.** Semantics-only entries price at the declared
 * sponsor exposure cap, because that is the only cost figure this repo is
 * entitled to state: transcribed vendor prices are ranking input, never billing
 * input.
 *
 * Nothing here decides whether a product is *usable* — trust evidence and
 * conformance are judged downstream at a supplied instant. Registration only
 * makes a product visible to that judgement.
