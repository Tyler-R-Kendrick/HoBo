// file and wait for a signal; `asked-twice` asks for the signal handlers a
// second time, as hobo-code's loader does on every /hobo verb; `two` makes a
// second directory first, as a process holding both a hobo-yard-* store and a
// hobo-pulumi-live-* workspace does; `graceful`
// first installs a SIGTERM handler of its own, as a server's graceful stop does,
// which records whether the directory is still there, then exits 0.
// `graceful-first` installs that handler before the entry point asks for the
// signal handlers, as hobo-code's shell has its own before a /hobo command
// first loads the composition.
