/**
 * The durable one-time-action store: sealing, single use, and denial.
 *
 * A one-time action that only exists in memory is a claim ceremony that cannot
 * survive the process that started it — and the ceremony is by definition the
 * step a human performs later. So this store is on the critical path of every
 * anonymous deployment someone eventually claims, and three of its properties
 * are security properties rather than conveniences.
 *
 * **Denial is not an oracle.** An unknown id, an id belonging to another
 * session, and an id whose audience does not match all produce the *same*
 * refusal. Distinguishing them would let a holder of one action enumerate
 * which ids exist and which fields they mismatch on — turning the store into a
 * lookup service for other people's pending claims. The tests assert the
 * messages are identical, not merely that each is refused.
 *
 * **Single use is enforced by rename, before decryption.** The atomic rename
 * is the gate: two concurrent redemptions cannot both win it, and the value is
 * only decrypted after it has been won. A store that decrypted first and
 * marked used afterwards would hand the plaintext to both racers.
 *
 * **The audit records outcomes, never the bearer.** The whole point of sealing
 * the value at rest is defeated if redeeming it writes it to a log, so there
 * is a test that scans the entire audit trail for the secret.
 *
 * The key lives in HOBO_HOME because that is the same trust boundary the
 * Station's own material sits behind. It is not a secrets manager and does not
 * pretend to be one — but it does have to survive a restart, so a second store
 * over the same home must be able to redeem what the first one sealed.
