/**
 * The failure matrix over a pact, against the drivers that ship.
 *
 * Replaces a lane that faulted one call, drove a hand-written `upsert` rather
 * than the product, and reported that a pact could not prove convergence. The
 * last was my own wrong conclusion: it generalised from the name-filtered
 * lookup (recorded only pre-create, `result: []`) to the whole document, which
 * also records `list all zone records` holding `rec1`. Both states were there;
 * only the sequencing was missing.
 *
 * Asserted, both computed from the pact: **convergence** (after a failure
 * anywhere, a retry lands one record, never creates against a record shown to
 * exist, never concludes "absent" from a read that failed) and **fidelity**
 * (every request sent while recovering has a recorded path, body and headers).
 *
 * Bound: these pacts are hand-authored consumer expectations. This proves the
 * drivers honour the contract the repo agreed on, not that the live API matches.
