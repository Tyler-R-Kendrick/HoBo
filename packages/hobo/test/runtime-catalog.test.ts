/**
 * The installable runtime catalog: `hobo add runtime-*` and what it registers.
 *
 * This module is three lookup tables and a set of catalog-entry factories, and
 * the tables are the interesting part. They translate between three
 * vocabularies that name the same four things — the install id an operator
 * types (`runtime-wasm`), the component-host kind a Yard config stores
 * (`wasm`), and the provider id the broker registry addresses
 * (`@hobo/runtime-wasm`). Every hop between them is a place the four can drift
 * apart, and nothing downstream would report the drift as such: a bad mapping
 * surfaces as a yard that installed one runtime and serves with another.
 *
 * **The install-id/host round trip is the invariant worth having.** It is
 * checked over `RUNTIME_INSTALL_IDS` itself rather than a hand-written list, so
 * adding a fifth runtime without extending both tables fails here rather than
 * at whatever point a Camp tries to serve on it.
 *
 * **`providerIdToHost` is a many-to-one map, deliberately.** Three spellings
 * mean `local` and two mean each of `wasm` and `oci`, because the legacy
 * sandbox/provider ids are still written into existing Yard configs and
 * broker state. Dropping one would make an installed runtime invisible on a
 * yard that had been working.
 *
 * **The factory's fallback is total, and that is a hazard.** Anything it does
 * not recognise becomes cloud-native rather than an error, so the tests state
 * that plainly rather than leaving it to be discovered.
