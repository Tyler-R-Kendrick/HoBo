/**
 * `hobo serve control` — the local control-plane HTTP+SSE listener.
 *
 * The command itself is thin: it resolves four settings and hands them to
 * `createControlApiServer`. Thin does not mean low-risk, because each of those
 * resolutions has a failure mode that shows up as something other than an
 * error:
 *
 * - **host** defaults to `127.0.0.1`. A default of `0.0.0.0` would expose the
 *   whole management surface — the same surface as the CLI and MCP — to the
 *   local network, and nothing about a successful bind would say so.
 * - **port** takes a flag, then the environment, then 8790, and falls back to
 *   8790 again if what it got is not a number. `Number("http")` is `NaN`, and
 *   an unguarded `NaN` binds an arbitrary ephemeral port, so the operator's
 *   bookmark quietly stops working.
 * - **hoboHome** decides which Yard the UI is looking at. Reading the wrong one
 *   shows an empty, healthy-looking yard rather than an error.
 * - **demo** feeds the world model from a simulator. If demo mode were not
 *   visible in the startup line, an operator could mistake simulated occupancy
 *   for their real one.
 *
 * Every test here uses `once: true` and port 0 so the process binds an
 * ephemeral port and closes immediately — a serve command that held the port
 * would hang the suite, and one that bound 8790 for real would collide with a
 * developer's own running server.
