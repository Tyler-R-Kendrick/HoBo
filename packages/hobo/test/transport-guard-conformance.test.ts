/**
 * Every provider transport guard faces the same refusal matrix.
 *
 * The guard is the only thing standing between a live bearer token and an
 * origin nobody vetted. Each resolver family builds its own policy — different
 * hosts, different path prefixes, different caps — but the *refusals* are
 * supposed to be identical, because they come from one implementation
 * (`guardTransport` in `@hobo/core`) parameterised per provider.
 *
 * "Supposed to be" is the problem this file exists for. Branch coverage on
 * these four guards sat between 50% and 67% before it, which on a security
 * boundary means: several refusal paths had never once been observed to fire.
 * A guard whose deny branch is untested is a guard you are trusting on the
 * strength of having read it.
 *
 * So this is a table, not four bespoke suites: the same six probes against
 * every policy, asserting each one is *refused* rather than clamped, repaired,
 * or quietly passed through. A provider added later gets the same treatment by
 * adding one row.
 *
 * It lives in `@hobo/hobo` for the same reason the chaos suite does: provider
 * packages are layer 2 and cannot import each other, so the composition root is
 * the only place a cross-provider suite can exist at all.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: this constrains the request each package composes and the
 * response it accepts. It cannot prove the *injected* transport honours
 * `timeoutMs`, refuses to chase a 302 itself, or terminates TLS against the
 * real certificate — those remain the host's obligations. Passing here is not
 * evidence that a live call was made.
