/**
 * `connection.test.ts` walks the Connection aggregate's lifecycle: create,
 * authorize, list, get. That is the path a working system takes, and it is not
 * the path that matters most here — a Connection is a credential-bearing object,
 * so the interesting behaviour is every refusal: cross-tenant access, a subject
 * that does not own the Connection, scopes that exceed what was granted, and a
 * revoked Connection that must never mint another token.
 *
 * This file drives those refusals, plus the parts of the aggregate the lifecycle
 * test cannot reach: `resolveForToken`'s selection order when several candidate
 * Connections exist, and the event-fold that a crash resume depends on. Each
 * denial asserts its *code*, not just that something threw — the code is what a
 * caller branches on to decide whether to prompt for re-auth or hard-fail, so a
 * refusal with the wrong code is nearly as bad as no refusal at all.
