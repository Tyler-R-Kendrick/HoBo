/**
 * Redis data structures are not delivery guarantees.
 *
 * Redis has lists, streams, and pub/sub, and every one of them looks like a
 * queue or a topic from a distance. None of them is one:
 *
 * - `LPUSH`/`RPOP` is a list with no acknowledgement, no redelivery, no
 *   visibility timeout, and no dead-letter path. A consumer that crashes after
 *   `RPOP` has silently dropped the message, which is the exact failure
 *   `queue.at-least-once/v1` exists to rule out.
 * - Redis pub/sub delivers to whoever is connected at the instant of publish
 *   and retains nothing, so it satisfies `topic.ephemeral-pubsub/v1` at best
 *   and never `topic.durable-log/v1`.
 * - Streams get closer, but consumer groups, offsets, and retention are their
 *   own semantics with their own failure modes, and they need their own
 *   conformance evidence.
 *
 * So the rule this module enforces is simple: evidence gathered against a
 * `kv.*` profile can never be reused as evidence for a `queue.*` or `topic.*`
 * profile. A product may implement both — it just has to prove both.
