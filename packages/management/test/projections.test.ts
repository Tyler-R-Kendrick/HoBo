/**
 * Folding Station and Connection state into the Yard projection.
 *
 * `management.test.ts` drives the ops surface; this covers the read model the
 * game UI actually renders. Everything here is a *derivation*, which is the
 * awkward category to test: nothing throws when it is wrong, the UI simply
 * shows something plausible and false.
 *
 * Three properties earn most of the attention:
 *
 * - **The provenance badges.** `trafficRate` is synthesized from connection
 *   counts, not measured; `activity.status` is derived from the connection
 *   lifecycle, not agent telemetry. The badges are the only thing separating a
 *   number that means something from a number that looks like it does. A
 *   projection that dropped them would make the UI's honest "synthetic" label
 *   disappear, and the rate would read as real.
 * - **Nothing is invented outside the event-sourced services.** The module
 *   header says the projection never fabricates occupancy, rail, or connection
 *   state. The tests below hold it to that: with an empty station, the rails and
 *   connections are empty and the metering figures are zero rather than
 *   defaults someone thought looked better.
 * - **Hazards are exhaustive.** A hazard that fails to fire is a warning the
 *   operator never sees, so each one is asserted on its own and in combination.
 *
 * The context is a hand-built fake rather than a real store, because the point
 * is to control the *input state* precisely — a real store would make several
 * of these states difficult to reach and impossible to isolate.
