/**
 * Evidence for the open question Swarm I settles: does `ResourceIntent` survive
 * as a distinct shape, or is it a projection of the request manifest?
 *
 * This package's answer is **it survives**, and the decisive field is
 * `placement` — with `deps` and `name` behind it. The evidence is structural
 * rather than rhetorical, and every part of it is read off the real source
 * files so it fails if the premise stops holding.
 *
 * The argument, in one line: `placement.affinities` and `placement.spread` are
 * constraints whose *operand is another node in the same plan*, and the request
 * manifest's evaluator has no channel through which a sibling node could be
 * seen. A per-capability requirement is evaluated against a catalog of
 * candidates; it is not evaluated against the rest of the graph, so a
 * relational constraint cannot be projected onto it without inventing that
 * channel — which would be a change to the request manifest, not a projection
 * of the declaration.
 *
 * A note on the brief, because it names the wrong shape. The decomposition
 * question is written as "`ResourceIntent` ... overlaps `CapabilityRequirement`
 * heavily", while §5 files `SelectionCandidate` as the request manifest.
 * `SelectionCandidate` is not a request at all: reading `selection.ts`, it is
 * the offer side — what a hosted product or pack *advertises* (`providerId`,
 * `implementsProfiles`, `evidenceSignatureValid`, `sponsorExposureMinorUnits`).
 * `CapabilityRequirement` is the ask. Both are checked below, because the
 * answer has to hold against whichever one "the request manifest" turns out to
 * mean.
