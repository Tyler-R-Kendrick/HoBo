// S3-06 — the adversarial prompt-injection corpus. Each case is a payload an
// attacker plants in a tool INPUT (an agent-supplied Camp selector / passthrough
// arg) or a tool OUTPUT (data a called tool returns), attempting to widen the
// caller's authority or trigger an unauthorized tool call. The hardening
// invariant (ADR-0023 item 3, ai-native-agent-auth.md §6.4) is that every case
// FAILS CLOSED: the injected text is recorded but powerless — authority derives
// only from the SVID scope, never from tool input or output — so no case widens
// the authorized tool set or dispatches an out-of-scope tool.
//
// test/injection.test.ts drives every case through the real SVID-bound server
// and asserts the invariant holds for each.
