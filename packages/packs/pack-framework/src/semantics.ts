/**
 * Projecting a verified pack into the product catalog.
 *
 * A pack is selectable by exactly the same machinery as a managed product — it
 * produces a Resource Definition vNext semantics block and a
 * {@link SelectionCandidate} — but three facts are not negotiable and are set
 * here rather than accepted from a caller:
 *
 * - `realization` is always `"pack"`. There is no code path that lets a
 *   container on generic compute advertise itself as a provider-native managed
 *   product, so a trust policy with `allowPack: false` genuinely excludes it.
 * - the claim strategy is the pack's own ownership strategy (Yard-owned, or
 *   migrate-on-claim), never a provider account claim. There is no provider
 *   account for a container the operator started.
 * - `sponsorExposureMinorUnits` is 0. The compute is the operator's own.
 *
 * The projection reads no clock: evidence expiry and signature validity are
 * required inputs, because a package that invented its own freshness would be
 * grading its own homework.
