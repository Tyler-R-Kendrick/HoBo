/**
 * Verification before execution — enforced by types, not by discipline.
 *
 * {@link verifyPackManifest} is the only producer of {@link VerifiedPackManifest},
 * and every surface that can cause something to run (the conformance harness,
 * the operation planner, the semantics projection that makes a pack selectable)
 * accepts nothing else. So "we forgot to check the signature before pulling" is
 * a compile error rather than an incident.
 *
 * Three rejections, all fail-closed:
 * - a moving tag or a malformed digest → `PACK_INTEGRITY_UNVERIFIED` (already
 *   raised during manifest parsing, re-asserted here for a manifest that was
 *   constructed rather than parsed);
 * - a missing, invalid, untrusted, or unknown-verdict signature →
 *   `PACK_INTEGRITY_UNVERIFIED`;
 * - a requested architecture the manifest does not pin →
 *   `ARCHITECTURE_UNSUPPORTED`.
 *
 * A signed payload whose digest does not match the manifest it arrived with is
 * `PROVIDER_CONTRACT_CHANGED`: the document changed after signing, which is a
 * different failure from a bad key and deserves a different code.
