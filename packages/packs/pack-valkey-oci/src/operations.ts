/**
 * Backup, migration, and maintenance as argv arrays.
 *
 * Same two rules as every pack operation: no shell, and no credential in argv.
 * The credential travels in `secretEnv` as a locator and is resolved into the
 * child environment at the moment of spawn, so a `ValkeyCommand` is safe to log,
 * to store in an event body, and to show a human in a plan.
 *
 * `REDISCLI_AUTH` is the environment variable used to authenticate the CLI. It is
 * inherited from `redis-cli`, and this pack has **not** verified it against a live
 * `valkey-cli` build (see README "Sources"). It is used here rather than
 * `--pass`/`-a` because those put the password in argv, where `ps` shows it to
 * every process on the host; if the variable turns out to be unsupported, the fix
 * is a different environment variable, not a move to argv.
