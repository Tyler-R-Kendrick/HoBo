/**
 * Planning an application, and the refusals the structural merge raises.
 *
 * `typescript-merge.test.ts` covers the merge decisions on files it *can* edit.
 * This covers the other half: the plan that precedes an apply, and every shape
 * the merge declines to touch.
 *
 * The refusals matter more than they look. This is an AST edit written back over
 * somebody's source, and the alternative to refusing is not failure — it is a
 * file that still compiles and means something the author did not write. A
 * snippet naming a symbol the file does not declare, a file with two bindle
 * definitions, a file that is not TypeScript at all: each of these is a case
 * where a "best effort" merge would produce plausible, wrong source.
 *
 * The plan carries the other property worth naming: an **expected preimage**.
 * It is the digest of the file as it stood when the plan was made, so an apply
 * against a file that changed underneath can be recognised rather than silently
 * clobbering somebody's edit. A file that does not exist yet gets an empty
 * preimage — a distinct state from "a file whose contents hashed to nothing".
