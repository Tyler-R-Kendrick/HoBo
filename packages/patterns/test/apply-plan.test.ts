/**
 * Planning a pattern application, and the path guard both halves share.
 *
 * `apply.test.ts` covers the structural merge; this covers the plan step and
 * the refusals, which is where a pattern application is stopped from touching
 * something it should not.
 *
 * **`assertSafe` is the whole containment story.** A pattern is applied inside
 * an isolation root and promoted afterwards, so a target path escaping that
 * root would write into the real project before anyone reviewed it. It refuses
 * on three separate grounds — a leading slash, a `..` segment, and a resolved
 * path outside the root — and the third is the backstop for anything the first
 * two miss.
 *
 * **A missing target is not an error.** A pattern that creates a file has no
 * preimage, so the plan records an empty expectation rather than failing;
 * treating "not there yet" as a fault would make every scaffolding pattern
 * unusable.
 *
 * **Promotion is always required.** The plan and the receipt both say so
 * unconditionally: an application that could mark itself promoted would defeat
 * the isolate-then-review model entirely.
