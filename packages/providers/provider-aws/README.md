# @hobo/provider-aws

The AWS `CloudProvider` (HOBO-711): RDS PostgreSQL, S3, Fargate, SQS,
ElastiCache, and DynamoDB behind HoBo's agnostic ports — the AWS row of the
cross-cloud equivalence table shipped as this provider's default Resource
Definitions.

| Port | AWS service | Resource class |
|---|---|---|
| `compute` | Fargate | `aws:fargate-service` |
| `kv` | DynamoDB | `aws:dynamodb-table` |
| `objectStore` | S3 | `aws:s3-bucket` |
| `database` | RDS PostgreSQL | `aws:rds-postgres` |
| `queue` | SQS | `aws:sqs-queue` |
| `cache` | ElastiCache (Redis) | `aws:elasticache-redis` |

- **Factory** `createAwsProvider({ regions })` (HOBO-87 authoring contract).
- **`.with()` builders**: `aws.with.fargate / rds / s3 / dynamodb / sqs /
  elasticache` — typed, additive, inert for non-resolved providers.
- **`realize()`** emits a `hobo.iac-program/v1` program for the primary
  Pulumi lane (`stack: aws/<deploymentId>`), with `binding` outputs so bind
  edges resolve across resources.
- **Keyless creds**: the published auth document pins `svid-federation` via
  `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` (HOBO-110) — `staticSecrets: false` is
  parse-enforced.
- **Cost facts**: declared real list-price magnitudes per SKU with monthly
  free-tier facts.
- Installable into the composed registry with `hobo add aws` (held/approve
  semantics per HOBO-710).

## Verification

```sh
pnpm --filter @hobo/provider-aws build
pnpm --filter @hobo/provider-aws test
```

## Default Yard catalog (what AWS *can* allocate)

`awsYardSpec()` and `AWS_DEFAULT_BINDINGS` (`src/default-yard.ts`) declare the
AWS Yard as an **allocatable catalog**: for each capability slot, the AWS
products that could satisfy it. It is not a mapping, not a pool, and not a
selection — each slot holds a *list*, and which entry an app gets is decided
later by capability selection (ADR-0151) against the requirements the app
states.

| Slot | Declared alternatives |
|---|---|
| `web` | App Runner, ECS service, EKS Deployment, Amplify Hosting (`web.hosted/v1`); S3 + CloudFront (`web.static/v1`) |
| `api` | API Gateway (`api.http/v1`) |
| `service` | Lambda (`service.worker/v1`); ECS task (`service.batch/v1`) |
| `data` | RDS for PostgreSQL, Aurora Serverless v2 (`data.postgres/v1`); RDS for MySQL (`data.mysql/v1`); DynamoDB (`data.document/v1`) |
| `kv` | DynamoDB (`kv.key-value/v1`); ElastiCache (`kv.redis-compatible/v1`) |
| `bucket` | S3 (`bucket.s3-compatible/v1`) |
| `queue` | SQS (`queue.at-least-once/v1`); SQS FIFO (`queue.fifo/v1`) |
| `topic` | SNS (`topic.pubsub/v1`) |
| `secretRef` | Secrets Manager, SSM Parameter Store (`secret-ref.locator/v1`) |

The catalog is built strictly from the typed factories in `src/slots.ts`. Most
slots hold several entries, because AWS genuinely hosts a web capability four
ways and satisfies `data` with three different engines. Which one a given
workload gets is decided at resolution time by ADR-0151 selection, against the
requirements the app states — never here. Adding a fifth `web` option is a
catalog edit, not a deployment change.

The catalog still does not enumerate all of AWS. Lightsail, Elastic Beanstalk,
Kinesis, MSK, Neptune, and others are not authored yet; a missing alternative is
a gap in the factory set, not a choice made by the Yard.

`awsYardSpec({ regions })` returns raw row-shaped data — `{ provider, regions,
bindings }` — because a provider package is a layer-2 adapter and may not
import `@hobo/yards`; that layer-3 package parses these rows into a canonical
set.

## HONEST SCOPE — catalog only, nothing here deploys

This change ships the **catalog only**. There is no HTTP deployment resolver
for AWS in this package (Cloudflare and Vercel are the two providers with
resolvers today), and the `aws.*` product ids the factories emit are **not
registered** in the definition catalog. A Yard built from this spec declares
what AWS *can* allocate; attempting to deploy against it **fails closed at
resolution** — `YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`, or no registered resolver —
until Resource Definitions and resolvers land. Nothing in this section should
be read as evidence that an AWS deployment works.

## Deployment resolvers (supersedes the "catalog only" note above)

The section above is now **out of date on one point**: this package ships
`ResourceResolver`s. It is left in place because this file is appended to
rather than rewritten; read this section as the current state.

`awsResolvers(options)` / `awsResolverRegistry(options)` (`src/resolvers.ts`)
call AWS service APIs directly over an injected, guarded transport. There is no
IaC engine, no state file, and no plan/apply round trip. What the catalog above
declares as allocatable, these resolvers allocate.

```ts
const registry = awsResolverRegistry({
	region: "us-east-1",
	nowMs: Date.now, // SigV4 signs a timestamp; the clock is injected, never read here
	resolveCredential: async (ref) => host.awsCredentialsFor(ref),
});
const transport = guardedAwsTransport(hostFetchTransport, "us-east-1");
await registry.get("aws.s3/v1")?.reconcile(request, transport);
```

### Endpoints covered

Coverage is a slice of each service — enough to allocate, observe, converge,
and remove the resource — not the whole surface.

| Product | Service / host | Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `aws.s3/v1` | REST-XML on `s3.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `GET /{bucket}?location` (existence probe), `GET/PUT /{bucket}?versioning`, `GET/PUT /{bucket}?publicAccessBlock`, `PUT /{bucket}`, `DELETE /{bucket}` |
| `aws.dynamodb/v1` | REST-JSON `x-amz-target` on `dynamodb.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `DescribeTable`, `CreateTable`, `UpdateTable`, `DeleteTable` |
| `aws.sqs/v1`, `aws.sqs-fifo/v1` | query protocol on `sqs.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `GetQueueUrl`, `CreateQueue`, `GetQueueAttributes`, `SetQueueAttributes`, `DeleteQueue` |
| `aws.sns/v1` | query protocol on `sns.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `ListTopics` (paged), `CreateTopic`, `GetTopicAttributes`, `SetTopicAttributes`, `DeleteTopic` |
| `aws.secrets-manager/v1` | REST-JSON `x-amz-target` on `secretsmanager.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `DescribeSecret`, `CreateSecret`, `UpdateSecret`, `RestoreSecret`, `DeleteSecret` |
| `aws.ssm-parameter-store/v1` | REST-JSON `x-amz-target` on `ssm.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `GetParameter`, `PutParameter`, `DeleteParameter` |

IAM actions for `aws.secrets-manager/v1`, per verb:

| Verb | Actions |
|---|---|
| `read` | `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret` |
| `reconcile` | `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret`, `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`, `secretsmanager:UpdateSecret`, and `secretsmanager:RestoreSecret` when `restoreScheduled: true` is declared |
| `delete` | `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret` (it describes the secret first), `secretsmanager:DeleteSecret` |

Path-style S3 addressing (`/{bucket}`) is deliberate: it keeps the transport
allowlist to one reviewable host per region instead of one host per bucket name
a caller happens to pass.

### Convergence, and why `replace` never appears

Every `reconcile()` is read-or-create: it asks AWS whether the
deterministically-named resource exists *before* it creates anything, then
applies only the mutable deltas. Running it twice yields one resource, the same
`physicalId`, and exactly one create call — asserted per product in
`test/resolvers.test.ts`. `delete()` treats "already gone" as success.

`"replace"` is never emitted. Replacing a bucket or a table destroys data, so
drift on an immutable field — an S3 bucket's region, a DynamoDB key schema, an
SSM parameter's type — is reported as a **diagnostic** and left for a human.
Declared options this resolver cannot honestly apply are diagnostics too, not
silent no-ops: S3 `storageClass` (no such bucket-level property), SQS
`maxReceiveCount` (needs a dead-letter queue ARN this resolver does not
create), Secrets Manager `rotationDays` (needs a rotation Lambda), SSM
`kmsKeyRef` (only meaningful for `SecureString`, which is refused).

### Products deliberately left unresolved

`AWS_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS` names them, and a test asserts the uncovered set is
exactly that list — so a new catalog entry cannot quietly become an unresolved
one. A resolver that duplicates a resource on every retry is worse than an
absent one.

| Product | Why there is no resolver |
|---|---|
| `aws.rds-postgres/v1`, `aws.rds-mysql/v1`, `aws.aurora-serverless-postgres/v1` | `CreateDBInstance`/`CreateDBCluster` take a `MasterUserPassword`, which would travel in `ResolveRequest.desired` — the record that reaches the event log and the plan digest. The managed-master-password path needs KMS + Secrets Manager wiring, and both paths need a DB subnet group and security group no binding names. |
| `aws.elasticache-redis/v1` | Placement needs a cache subnet group and security group no binding names; omitting them silently lands the cluster in the default VPC. |
| `aws.lambda/v1` | `CreateFunction` needs deployment-package bytes and an execution-role ARN; the binding carries neither. |
| `aws.ecs-service/v1`, `aws.ecs-task/v1`, `aws.eks-deployment/v1` | Cluster, task-execution role, and network configuration live outside the binding; an EKS Deployment is a Kubernetes API object and is not reachable over this transport at all. |
| `aws.app-runner/v1`, `aws.amplify-hosting/v1` | Creation is source-connection-scoped and returns a new ARN per call, with no documented list-by-name filter to converge against. |
| `aws.api-gateway/v1` | `CreateRestApi`/`CreateApi` assign a fresh random id per call with no name-uniqueness, so a retry after a lost response creates a second API. |
| `aws.cloudfront-site/v1` | `CreateDistribution` returns a new id per call; the caller reference is a deduplication window, not an identity. |

### Signing, credentials, and the transport guard

AWS does not accept a bearer token, so every request is signed with SigV4 by
`@hobo/core/aws-sigv4`. That signer is pinned in `@hobo/core`'s tests against
the official `aws-sig-v4-test-suite` vectors (`get-vanilla`,
`get-vanilla-query-order-key-case`, `get-header-key-duplicate`,
`get-header-value-order`, `get-header-value-trim`, `get-unreserved`,
`get-utf8`, `post-header-key-sort`, `post-x-www-form-urlencoded`), asserting the
canonical request, the string-to-sign, and the `Authorization` header for each
— the only real proof of a signer available to a repo that cannot reach the
live API.

Credentials are **locators**. `credentialRef` must match core's `scheme://path`
grammar; a value-shaped ref is refused with `RESOLVER_CREDENTIAL_NOT_A_REF`
before a call is spent. The host's injected `resolveCredential(ref)` returns
the access key id, secret access key, and optional session token, and material
appears in exactly one place — the `authorization` request header. The secret
access key is never transmitted at all (SigV4 sends a signature derived from
it), and provider error text is redacted before it reaches any message,
diagnostic, or output.

`guardedAwsTransport(inner, region)` applies the policy in `src/transport.ts`:
HTTPS only, exact-match allowlisted regional hosts for the six services above,
bounded body (512 KiB) and time (15 s), no redirect chasing. A region that does
not parse — or a China-partition region, whose endpoints terminate at a
different suffix — is refused rather than interpolated into a hostname.

### HONEST SCOPE — what the resolvers prove and what they do not

- The resolvers are exercised against an **injected fake transport** modelling
  an AWS account. That proves request formation, convergence, refusal codes,
  and redaction. It proves **nothing** about a live AWS account: no live call
  is made anywhere in this package's tests, no real credential is used, and no
  network egress happens.
- The SigV4 vectors prove the signature is computed as the published test suite
  says it should be. They do not prove any request was accepted or authorized.
- The transport guard constrains the request this package composes and the
  response it accepts. It cannot prove the injected transport honours
  `timeoutMs`, refuses to follow a 302 itself, or terminates TLS against the
  real AWS certificate — those remain the host's obligations.
- Resolvers do not create Resource Definitions. Whether a matching definition is
  registered in the catalog is still checked at resolution time
  (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`).
- A Secrets Manager secret **scheduled for deletion** (DescribeSecret answers
  `DeletedDate`) still holds its name for its recovery window, and AWS refuses
  CreateSecret, UpdateSecret and a second unforced DeleteSecret for it
  ([ADR-0175](../../../docs/design/adr/07-portability-extensibility.md#adr-0175)).
  - `read` reports it with action `delete`, `outputs.deletedDate`, and a
    diagnostic: "scheduled for deletion until <date>", then what apply will do.
    Preview and drift say so; neither reports it absent.
  - `reconcile` **fails closed** by default (`RESOLVER_PROVIDER_REJECTED`): someone
    deleted it on purpose. Declare `restoreScheduled: true` to restore it with its
    previous versions (`RestoreSecret`, reported as `update`), or destroy it with
    `forceDelete: true` to delete it now. Both are `SecretsManagerOptions`
    fields: `secretsManager({ restoreScheduled: true })`,
    `secretsManager({ forceDelete: true })`. A forced delete cannot be undone.
  - `delete` issues nothing more for it, and a `forceDelete: true` delete still
    deletes it at once. An `InvalidRequestException` because someone scheduled it
    between the describe and the delete counts as done.
  - `restoreScheduled` and `forceDelete` are directives: they say how apply and
    delete act, not what the secret is, and `read` never reports them. The
    resolver lists them in its `directives`, so preview and drift leave them out
    of the comparison and say so. A plan that keeps either one previews and
    refreshes a live secret as clean as it would without it.
- Secrets Manager secrets are created **without a version**, and SSM
  `SecureString` parameters are **refused**: in both cases the value is
  credential material, and this resolver never carries it.
