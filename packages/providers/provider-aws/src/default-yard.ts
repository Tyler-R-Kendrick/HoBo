/**
 * The default AWS Yard catalog: what AWS *can* allocate, per slot.
 *
 * A Yard declares allocatable capacity. It is not a mapping, not a pool, not a
 * selection, and not a record of what an app uses — so a slot holds a *list*,
 * and several entries in one slot are the normal case, with selection
 * (ADR-0151) picking among them later against the requirements the app
 * actually states. Collapsing a slot to a single value would quietly make this
 * module the selector, which is exactly the decision the Yard is not allowed to
 * take.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — how full this catalog is: it is built strictly from the typed
 * factories `./slots.ts` ships, which today are `s3`, `rds.postgres`,
 * `dynamodb`, `sqs`, `eks.deployment` and `lambda`. That is one entry per slot.
 * AWS obviously offers more than one way to host a web app or store a
 * document; those alternatives are simply not authored yet, so this catalog
 * under-declares AWS rather than mis-declaring it. A missing alternative is a
 * gap in the factory set, not a choice made here.
 *
 * `awsYardSpec()` emits raw row-shaped data rather than a `Yard`: this is a
 * layer-2 provider package, so it may import `@hobo/core` and nothing else
 * HoBo — `@hobo/yards` (layer 3) is the package that parses these rows into a
 * canonical, deduplicated set. The rows are sorted by
 * `(profile, productId, connectivityId)`, the same canonical order
 * `parseYardBindings` imposes, so the hand-off is byte-stable.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock, no randomness, no environment reads. Two calls with
 * the same options are deep-equal.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — what deploys: still nothing. This is the catalog, meaning
 * what AWS is *able* to allocate (ADR-0157 decision 1), not what is allocated.
 * This package registers no Resource Definitions for the `aws.*` product ids,
 * so a deploy attempted against this Yard fails closed at resolution
 * (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`) until definitions land. It does now ship
 * SigV4-signed resolvers, but for 7 of the 19 ids only
 * (`AWS_RESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS`), and those are proven against an injected fake
 * transport — no live AWS call has been made from this repo.
