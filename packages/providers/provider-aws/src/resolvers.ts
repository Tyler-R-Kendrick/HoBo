/**
 * Direct AWS service-API resource resolvers — the default deployment path.
 *
 * Why this module exists: this package used to publish an allocatable AWS
 * catalog and ship no `ResourceResolver`, so a deploy against an AWS Yard
 * failed closed. These resolvers close that gap the same way the Cloudflare
 * and Vercel ones do: a `ResourceResolver` per product talks to the AWS
 * service API over an injected, guarded transport and reconciles one resource
 * at a time. There is no IaC engine, no state file, and no plan/apply round
 * trip between "what the Yard says can be allocated" and "what exists in the
 * account".
 *
 * The property that makes that safe is **convergence**. Every `reconcile()`
 * here is read-or-create: it asks AWS whether the deterministically-named
 * resource already exists — by a direct describe where the API offers one, by
 * a bounded paged list where it does not — *before* it creates anything, then
 * applies only the mutable deltas. Running it twice produces the same
 * `physicalId`, exactly one resource, and exactly one create call, which is
 * what makes a crashed half-apply safe to re-run instead of something an
 * operator reconciles by hand. `delete()` treats "already gone" as success for
 * the same reason. `"replace"` is never emitted: replacing a bucket or a table
 * destroys data, so drift on an immutable field is reported as a diagnostic
 * and left for a human.
 *
 * A product with no convergent path ships **no resolver** rather than a
 * plausible one — see {@link AWS_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS}, which names each one
 * and why. A resolver that duplicates a resource on every retry is worse than
 * an absent one.
 *
 * AWS does not take a bearer token. Every request is signed with SigV4 by
 * `@hobo/core/aws-sigv4`, whose signer is pinned against the official
 * `aws-sig-v4-test-suite` vectors in `@hobo/core`'s tests — the only proof of
 * a signer available to a repo that cannot reach the live API. Credentials are
 * *locators*: a resolver is constructed with an injected
 * `resolveCredential(ref)`, `ResolveRequest.credentialRef` must match core's
 * `scheme://path` grammar, and material appears in exactly one place — the
 * `authorization` request header — never in an outcome, a diagnostic, or a
 * message. Provider error text is redacted before it reaches any of those,
 * because AWS echoes request context (including the access key id) in error
 * bodies.
 *
 * Three wire shapes, handled honestly rather than pretended into one:
 *   - **REST-XML** (S3): the operation is the HTTP method plus a subresource
 *     query; responses are XML.
 *   - **REST-JSON with a target header** (DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, SSM):
 *     `POST /` with `x-amz-target` naming the operation and a JSON body.
 *   - **Query protocol** (SQS, SNS): `POST /` with an `Action=…` form body and
 *     an XML response.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock and no randomness in request formation. SigV4 does
 * genuinely need a timestamp, so it is injected (`AwsResolverOptions.nowMs`)
 * and never read from `Date.now()` here, which is what makes a signed request
 * byte-stable in a test.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE (also in the README):
 *   - These resolvers are exercised against an *injected fake* transport
 *     modelling an AWS account. Nothing in this package proves a live deploy:
 *     that additionally needs real credentials, real network egress, and a
 *     real AWS account, none of which a unit test supplies.
 *   - The `productId` strings are read off the `./slots.js` factories, so the
 *     resolver registry and the Yard catalog cannot drift apart. Whether a
 *     matching Resource Definition is registered in the catalog is still
 *     checked at resolution time (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`), not here.
 *   - Coverage is a slice of each service's API — enough to allocate, observe,
 *     converge, and remove the resource — and explicitly not the whole
 *     surface. The exact endpoints are named in the README.

 * take a `MasterUserPassword`. That value would have to travel in
 * `ResolveRequest.desired` — the record that reaches the event log, the plan
 * digest, and every diagnostic printed from them — which is exactly what the

 * key and a Secrets Manager attachment this package cannot derive, and both
 * paths additionally need a DB subnet group and a security group that a Yard
 * binding does not name. Refused rather than half-built.
 * `aws.elasticache-redis/v1`: `CreateCacheCluster` places the cluster in a
 * cache subnet group and a security group that no binding names; omitting them
 * silently lands the cluster in the default VPC, which is a network decision
 * this resolver is not entitled to take.
 * `aws.lambda/v1`: `CreateFunction` requires deployment-package bytes and an
 * execution-role ARN. The binding carries neither, and a function with no code
 * is not a function.
 * `aws.ecs-service/v1`, `aws.ecs-task/v1`, `aws.eks-deployment/v1`: every one
 * needs a cluster, a task-execution role, and a network configuration that
 * exist outside the binding; and an EKS Deployment is a Kubernetes API object,
 * not an AWS API one, so it is not reachable over this transport at all.
 * `aws.app-runner/v1`, `aws.amplify-hosting/v1`: creation is
 * source-connection-scoped (an ECR image or a connected repository) and
 * returns a new service ARN per call, with no documented list-by-name filter
 * to converge against.
 * `aws.api-gateway/v1`: `CreateRestApi`/`CreateApi` assign a fresh random API
 * id on every call and there is no name-unique constraint, so a retry after a
 * lost response creates a second API.
 * `aws.cloudfront-site/v1`: `CreateDistribution` returns a new distribution id
