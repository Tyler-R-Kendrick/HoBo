/**
 * The AWS-scoped guard policy for the injected HTTP transport.
 *
 * Why this module exists: the resolvers in `./resolvers.ts` call AWS service
 * APIs directly — there is no IaC engine in the middle — and every one of
 * those requests carries a SigV4 signature computed from a live access key. A
 * driver that trusts whatever transport (and whatever URL) it is handed can be
 * pointed at an attacker's origin by one bad config value, and the signature,
 * the access key id, and any session token go with it. So the transport is
 * always injected, and the policy below is what makes any injected transport
 * safe on this path. The enforcement itself lives in `guardTransport()` in
 * `@hobo/core`; this module owns only the AWS-specific numbers and hosts, so
 * the rule set cannot drift per provider package.
 *
 * AWS differs from the single-origin providers in one way that matters: its
 * endpoints are *regional*, so there is no one host to allowlist. The policy
 * is therefore built per region and lists the exact regional host of each
 * service a resolver in this package addresses — six hosts, no wildcards. A
 * region that does not parse is refused rather than interpolated, because
 * `s3.{whatever}.amazonaws.com` is a request to a host nobody reviewed.
 *
 * The path allowlist is `/` and only `/`, which looks permissive and is not:
 * five of the six services accept exactly one path (`/`, with the operation in
 * a header or a form body), and S3 addresses a single bucket segment. There is
 * no narrower prefix that admits `/{bucket}` without also admitting every
 * sibling path, so the honest constraint here is the host list plus the
 * scheme, and this comment says so rather than implying a path check is doing
 * work it is not.
 *
 * China (`cn-`) regions are refused: they terminate at `amazonaws.com.cn`, a
 * different suffix, and guessing the suffix from a region prefix is how a
 * credential ends up addressed to the wrong partition.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`. Reaching the network is always
 * something a host decided to hand over, never something a library reached for.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: the guard constrains the request this package composes and the
 * response it accepts. It cannot prove the injected transport honours
 * `timeoutMs`, refuses to follow a 302 itself, or terminates TLS against the
 * real AWS certificate — those are the host's obligations. Passing the guard
 * is not evidence that a live call was made.
