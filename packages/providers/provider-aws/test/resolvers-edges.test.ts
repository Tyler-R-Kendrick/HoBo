/**
 * AWS resolver edges — the shared plumbing under every product.
 *
 * The suite next door drives the happy shapes. This file drives the wrapper and
 * the two body readers: credentials, redaction, the bounded XML scanner, the
 * JSON and XML refusal paths, and the adopt/noop distinction. All seven
 * resolvers inherit them, so a defect here is a defect seven times over — and
 * each of these paths runs exactly when something has already gone wrong.
 *
 * Three properties do most of the work:
 *
 * **Resolved material never survives into text.** AWS error bodies echo request
 * context and have carried an access key id. Redaction removes the resolved
 * material by exact match *first* — that is the part that must never survive —
 * and only then scrubs anything else token-shaped. A resolver that redacted
 * only by pattern would depend on the pattern being right about a secret it was
 * handed and could have matched exactly.
 *
 * **The XML reader is bounded and deliberately incomplete.** It is a forward
 * `indexOf` scan: no regex, so no catastrophic backtracking on a hostile body,
 * and no recursion, so no stack growth with nesting depth. It also must not
 * confuse `<Code>` with `<CodeSigningConfig>`, which is exactly the kind of
 * prefix collision a naive `indexOf` gets wrong and which would make an error
 * code read as something else entirely.
 *
 * **An unknown outcome is refused, never assumed.** A body this code cannot
 * parse leaves the effect of the call unknown, and both ways of guessing are
 * worse than a typed refusal.
 *
 * Everything runs through an injected fake transport and an injected clock. No
 * network, no credential, no AWS account.
