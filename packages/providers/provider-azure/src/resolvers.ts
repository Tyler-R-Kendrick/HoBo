/**
 * Direct Azure Resource Manager resource resolvers — the default deployment
 * path for the Azure Yard.
 *
 * Why this module exists: `./default-yard.ts` publishes an allocatable Azure
 * catalog, but a Yard that nothing can deploy against is a catalog with a
 * closed door behind it. These resolvers open the door for the products whose
 * ARM surface is genuinely convergent: a `ResourceResolver` talks to
 * `https://management.azure.com` over an injected, guarded transport and
 * reconciles one product at a time. There is no IaC engine, no state file, and
 * no plan/apply round trip in between.
 *
 * The property that makes that safe is convergence. Every `reconcile()` here is
 * read-or-create: it `GET`s the *deterministically named* ARM resource id
 * before it writes anything, `PUT`s only when the resource is absent, and then
 * applies only the mutable deltas. Running it twice produces the same
 * `physicalId` and exactly one resource, which is what makes a crashed
 * half-apply safe to re-run instead of something an operator reconciles by
 * hand. `delete()` treats "already gone" as success for the same reason.
 *
 * ARM helps here in a way most REST APIs do not: `PUT` on a resource id is
 * declarative and idempotent. That is *only* worth anything because the name is
 * deterministic — `desired.name` falling back to `ref.logicalId`, never a
 * generated one — so the second `PUT` addresses the same id as the first. Where
 * this module leans on idempotent-PUT it is leaning on that pairing, not on
 * PUT alone.
 *
 * Two ARM specifics shape almost every line below:
 *
 *  1. **`api-version` is mandatory and load-bearing.** ARM refuses a call
 *     without one and silently serializes a *different* resource model for the
 *     wrong one — which is how a declared field quietly stops being applied.
 *     So every version is pinned as a named constant per resource type, with
 *     the reason on the declaration, and `azureArmUrl()` takes it as a required
 *     argument rather than defaulting one.
 *  2. **Most ARM writes are long-running operations.** A `PUT` answers `201`
 *     or `202` with an `Azure-AsyncOperation` or `Location` header, or a `200`
 *     whose body says `provisioningState: "Creating"`, and the resource does
 *     not exist yet. This module never reports such a response as a finished
 *     create. It follows the operation to a terminal state through the same
 *     injected transport, bounded by an injected poll budget (no clock, no
 *     unbounded loop); and when the budget runs out with the operation still
 *     running, the outcome says so in `diagnostics` — accepted, not confirmed —
 *     rather than reading as done.
 *
 * Credentials are locators, never material. A resolver is constructed with an
 * injected `resolveCredential(ref)`; `ResolveRequest.credentialRef` must look
 * like a reference (`env://AZURE_ARM_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `secret://…`) and a value
 * that looks like the bearer token itself is refused, because a raw token in a
 * request record is a token in the event log. The resolved token appears in
 * exactly one place — the `authorization` request header — and never in an
 * outcome, a diagnostic, or a message.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`, and nothing reads a clock, an
 * environment variable, or a random source: request bodies are a pure function
 * of the request.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE (also in the README):
 *   - These resolvers are exercised in tests against an *injected fake*
 *     transport. Nothing in this package proves a live deploy: that
 *     additionally needs real credentials, real network egress, a real
 *     subscription, and a real resource group, none of which a unit test
 *     supplies.
 *   - The pinned `api-version` values were written from Azure's published REST
 *     documentation. They have not been verified against the running service
 *     by this package, and a version that has been retired would fail at the
 *     first call rather than silently.
 *   - Coverage is a slice of each product's ARM surface — enough to allocate,
 *     observe, converge, and remove the resource — and explicitly not the whole
 *     surface. Products whose ARM surface is not convergent under this contract
 *     ship *no* resolver and are named in {@link AZURE_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS}.
 *   - `"replace"` is never emitted. Replacing a storage container, a database
 *     account, or a vault destroys data, so drift on an immutable field is
 *     reported as a diagnostic for a human and never silently "fixed".

 * Product ids this package catalogs but deliberately does **not** resolve.
 *
 * A non-convergent resolver is worse than an absent one — it creates a second
 * resource on every retry — so the absences are declared here and asserted by a
 * test rather than left to be discovered at deploy time. Two kinds of absence
 * are mixed in this list on purpose, and each id says which it is:
 *
 * `azure.aks/v1` — **no convergent ARM path.** The binding's options (replicas,
 * service type, resource limits, image) describe a Kubernetes Deployment and
 * Service, which live behind the *cluster's* Kubernetes API, not ARM. The ARM
 * `managedClusters` PUT would create a different resource than the binding
 * describes, so there is nothing here for an ARM resolver to converge.
 *
 * `azure.api-management/v1` — **no honestly bounded operation.** `PUT
 * …/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{name}` is routinely a 30–45 minute
 * long-running operation. No poll budget a deploy call can carry reaches its
 * terminal state, so every outcome would be "accepted, not confirmed"; and the
 * create additionally requires `publisherEmail`/`publisherName` that the
 * binding does not name.
 *
 * `azure.postgres-flexible/v1` — **the create needs credential material.** A
 * Flexible Server create under the default password authentication requires
 * `administratorLogin` and `administratorLoginPassword` in the request body,
 * and a `ResolveRequest.desired` bag may not carry either (core refuses
 * credential-shaped keys, correctly). The Entra-only alternative
 * (`authConfig.passwordAuth: "Disabled"`) additionally needs an administrator
 * assignment through a separate sub-resource, so it is not one convergent PUT.
 *
 * `azure.sql-database/v1` — **the same credential problem, one level up.** The
 * database PUT is convergent, but it needs a logical server parent whose own
 * create requires an administrator login and password.
 *
 * `azure.app-service/v1` and `azure.functions/v1` — **the binding names no
 * parent.** A site needs a `Microsoft.Web/serverfarms` plan (and a Functions app
 * additionally needs a storage account whose *connection string* is credential
 * material). The bindings name a plan sku but no plan, and inventing one would
 * make the resolver own a resource the request never described.
 *
 * `azure.static-web-apps/v1` — **a coverage gap, not a design limit.** The ARM
 * surface is convergent, but a Static Web App created without a repository and
 * repository token is an empty site, which is a half-truth this package would
 * rather not ship than ship silently.
