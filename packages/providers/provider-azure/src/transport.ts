/**
 * The Azure-scoped guard policy for the injected HTTP transport.
 *
 * Why this module exists: the resolvers in `./resolvers.ts` talk to Azure
 * Resource Manager directly — there is no IaC engine in the middle — and every
 * one of those requests carries a live AAD bearer token in its headers. A
 * driver that trusts whatever transport (and whatever URL) it is handed can be
 * pointed at an attacker's origin by one bad config value, and the token goes
 * with it. ARM makes that risk sharper than most providers do, because a
 * long-running operation hands the *provider* control of the next URL the
 * client calls: `Azure-AsyncOperation` and `Location` are response headers, so
 * the poll target is attacker-influenced by construction. The policy below is
 * what makes following one of those headers safe: HTTPS-only, one exact host,
 * one path prefix, no redirect chasing, bounded body, bounded time. The
 * enforcement itself lives in `guardTransport()` in `@hobo/core`; this module
 * owns only the Azure-specific numbers, so the rule set cannot drift per
 * provider package.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`. Reaching the network is always
 * something a host decided to hand over, never something a library reached for.
 *
 * ARM's other standing hazard is the mandatory `api-version` query parameter.
 * A call without one is refused by ARM; a call with the *wrong* one silently
 * serializes a different resource model, which is how a field quietly stops
 * being applied. So `azureArmUrl()` takes the version as a required argument
 * rather than defaulting one, and the versions themselves are pinned per
 * resource type as named constants in `./resolvers.ts`.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: the guard constrains the request this package composes and the
 * response it accepts. It cannot prove the injected transport honours
 * `timeoutMs`, refuses to follow a 302 itself, or terminates TLS against the
 * real ARM certificate — those are the host's obligations, restated in the
 * README. Passing the guard is not evidence that a live call was made.
