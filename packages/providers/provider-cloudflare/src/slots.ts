/**
 * Typed Cloudflare offering factories for Yard slot bindings.
 *
 * Why this module exists: authoring a slot binding by hand means typing a
 * capability-profile string, a product id, and an untyped property bag — three
 * independent chances to make a typo that only surfaces at resolution time.
 * Each factory here owns exactly one `(slot, profile, productId)` triple and
 * takes a per-product options interface, so the profile string is never typed
 * by an operator and a misspelled option name is a compile error.
 *
 * Every factory returns `slotBinding()` from `@hobo/core`; none of them build a
 * binding record by hand. The core parse boundary — credential screening,
 * JSON-safety, freezing, key ordering — therefore applies to every binding
 * produced here, and this module adds no parse rules of its own.
 *
 * No defaults are invented. A setting silently chosen on the caller's behalf
 * would misreport what they asked for, so an omitted option is simply absent
 * from `properties` and the Resource Definition decides.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: the `productId` values below are the ids these factories
 * *emit*. Whether a matching Resource Definition is registered in the catalog
 * is checked at resolution time (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`), not here — a
 * successful call is not evidence that the product exists in the catalog
 * today, and several of these products are not registered yet.

/**
 * Forwards the caller's option bag to the parse boundary, dropping only keys
 * whose value is `undefined` (an omitted option must be absent, not an
 * explicit `undefined`, under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and JSON-safety).
 *
 * Every remaining key is passed through — including one the option types do
 * not declare — so a key smuggled past the types reaches `slotBinding()` and
 * is screened there. Cherry-picking the known keys instead would silently
 * swallow it, which is exactly the kind of quiet drop this repo refuses.
