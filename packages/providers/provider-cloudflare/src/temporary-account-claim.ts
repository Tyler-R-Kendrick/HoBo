/**
 * What happens after a human claims the temporary account.
 *
 * Cloudflare states that "claiming does not grant the platform permanent access
 * to the account". HoBo takes that literally: the claim is the end of the
 * bootstrap relationship, not the start of a management one. Three things are
 * therefore separate and individually enforced here —
 *
 *  1. ownership is verified independently, against the provider, not inferred
 *     from the fact that we handed someone a URL;
 *  2. every residual bootstrap credential is destroyed, and the account is not
 *     considered clean until the provider agrees the token is gone;
 *  3. continuing HoBo/agent management requires a *new* authorization ceremony
 *     (`creatorAuthorityAfterClaim: "reauthorization-required"`).
