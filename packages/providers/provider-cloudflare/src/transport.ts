/**
 * The Cloudflare-scoped guard policy for the injected HTTP transport.
 *
 * Why this module exists: the resolvers in `./resolvers.ts` talk to
 * Cloudflare's REST API directly — there is no IaC engine in the middle — and
 * every one of those requests carries a live account credential in its
 * headers. A driver that trusts whatever transport (and whatever URL) it is
 * handed can be pointed at an attacker's origin by one bad config value, and
 * the credential goes with it. So the transport is always injected, and the
 * policy below is what makes any injected transport safe on this path:
 * HTTPS-only, one exact host, one path prefix, no redirect chasing, bounded
 * body, bounded time. The enforcement itself lives in `guardTransport()` in
 * `@hobo/core`; this module only owns the Cloudflare-specific numbers, so the
 * rule set cannot drift per provider package.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`. Reaching the network is always
 * something a host decided to hand over, never something a library reached for.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: the guard constrains the request this package composes and the
 * response it accepts. It cannot prove the injected transport honours
 * `timeoutMs`, refuses to follow a 302 itself, or terminates TLS against the
 * real Cloudflare certificate — those are the host's obligations, restated in
 * the README. Passing the guard is not evidence that a live call was made.
