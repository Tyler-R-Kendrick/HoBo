// Convex equivalence classes (ADR-0144 thin-adapter rule): the reactive
// TypeScript BaaS mapped honestly onto HoBo's agnostic ports. Feature lists
// are deliberately NARROW — a document store with code-side joins cannot
// claim relational or graph semantics, so `require` misses surface as
// partial(missing) verdicts with remediation, never fabricated parity.
// Vector search and scheduled functions ride as capability FEATURES because
// HoBo has no `vector` or scheduler port today (documented in
// docs/competitors/convex.md "Impedance boundaries").
