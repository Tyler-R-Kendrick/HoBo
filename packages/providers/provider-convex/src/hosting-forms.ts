/**
 * The three ways HoBo can stand up a Convex backend, as DATA.
 *
 * They are kept structurally distinct on purpose. Conflating them is the
 * failure mode this module exists to prevent:
 *
 * - `convex.local-accountless/v1` is a development deployment that lives and
 *   dies with `npx convex dev`. Putting a tunnel in front of it makes it
 *   *reachable*; it does not make it durable, and it is never a capability
 *   claim.
 * - `convex.selfhosted-oci/v1` is the official container with a persistent
 *   volume (and optionally an external SQL database and S3-compatible object
 *   storage). This is the form a production claim can cite.
 * - `convex.cloud-sponsored-transfer/v1` is a Convex Cloud deployment created
 *   under a named sponsor account and transferred to the user's own team. It
 *   is sponsor-backed, NOT anonymous, and the sponsor's deploy keys are
 *   revoked once the transfer lands.
 *
 * Everything here is deep-frozen data with no behavior and no credential
 * values. Config is referenced by NAME plus a sensitivity marker; the record
 * type has no field that could hold a secret.
