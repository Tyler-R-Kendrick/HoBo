/**
 * The DigitalOcean-scoped guard policy for the injected HTTP transport.
 *
 * Why this module exists: the resolvers in `./resolvers.ts` call the
 * DigitalOcean API directly — there is no IaC engine in the middle — and every
 * one of those requests carries a live personal access token in its
 * `authorization` header. A driver that trusts whatever transport (and whatever
 * URL) it is handed can be pointed at an attacker's origin by one bad config
 * value, and the token goes with it. So the transport is always injected, and
 * the policy below is what makes an injected transport safe on this path:
 * HTTPS only, one exact host, one path prefix, no redirect chasing, bounded
 * body, bounded time. Enforcement itself lives in `guardTransport()` in
 * `@hobo/core`; this module owns only the DigitalOcean-specific numbers and
 * hosts, so the rule set cannot drift per provider package.
 *
 * DigitalOcean is the easy case for a guard and this module does not pretend
 * otherwise: the whole v2 control plane is one host and one prefix, so the
 * policy is a constant rather than something built per region. The one API
 * surface that is *not* on this host is Spaces, which speaks S3 on
 * `<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com` with SigV4 — a different host, a different
 * signature, and therefore deliberately not allowlisted here. That is why
 * `digitalocean.spaces/v1` ships no resolver rather than a resolver reaching a
 * host this policy would have to be widened for.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`. Reaching the network is always
 * something a host decided to hand over, never something a library reached for.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: the guard constrains the request this package composes and the
 * response it accepts. It cannot prove the injected transport honours
 * `timeoutMs`, refuses to follow a 302 itself, or terminates TLS against the
 * real DigitalOcean certificate — those are the host's obligations. Passing the
 * guard is not evidence that a live call was made.
