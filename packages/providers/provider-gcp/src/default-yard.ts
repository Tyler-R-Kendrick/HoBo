/**
 * The default Google Cloud Yard catalog: what GCP *can* allocate, per slot.
 *
 * A Yard declares allocatable capacity. It is not a mapping, not a pool, not a
 * selection, and not a record of what an app uses — so a slot commonly carries
 * several entries. `web` here lists Cloud Run, App Engine and a Cloud Storage
 * site side by side, because all three can host a web capability on GCP; which
 * one a given app gets is decided later by selection (ADR-0151), against the
 * requirements the app actually states. Collapsing a slot to one entry would
 * quietly make this module the selector, which is exactly the decision the Yard
 * is not allowed to take.
 *
 * `gcpYardSpec()` emits raw row-shaped data rather than a `Yard`: this is a
 * layer-2 provider package, so it may import `@hobo/core` and nothing else
 * HoBo — `@hobo/yards` (layer 3) is the package that parses these rows into a
 * canonical, deduplicated set. The rows are sorted by
 * `(profile, productId, connectivityId)`, the same canonical order
 * `parseYardBindings` imposes, so the hand-off is byte-stable.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock, no randomness, no environment reads. Two calls with
 * the same options are deep-equal.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE: this is the catalog — what GCP is *able* to allocate
 * (ADR-0157 decision 1), not what is allocated. This package registers no
 * Resource Definitions for the `gcp.*` product ids below, so a deploy still
 * fails closed at resolution (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`) until definitions
 * land. It does now ship Google REST resolvers, but for 8 of the 14 ids only
 * (`GCP_RESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS`), and those are proven against an injected fake
 * transport, never a live project. A row in this Yard is not a promise that
 * the row deploys.
