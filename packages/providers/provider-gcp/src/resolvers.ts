/**
 * Direct Google Cloud REST resource resolvers — the default deployment path.
 *
 * Why this module exists: `@hobo/provider-gcp` published an allocatable Yard
 * catalog and no way to realize any of it, so a deploy against a GCP Yard
 * failed closed for want of a resolver. These resolvers close that gap the way
 * Cloudflare and Vercel already do: a `ResourceResolver` per product, talking to
 * Google's REST APIs over an injected, per-service-guarded transport, with no
 * IaC engine and no state file in the middle.
 *
 * The property that makes that safe is convergence. Every `reconcile()` here is
 * read-or-create: it GETs the deterministically named resource *before* it
 * creates anything, creates only when the read says absent, then applies the
 * mutable deltas. Running it twice yields the same `physicalId`, exactly one
 * resource, and exactly one create call — which is what makes a crashed
 * half-apply safe to re-run instead of something an operator reconciles by
 * hand. `delete()` treats "already gone" as success for the same reason.
 * `"replace"` is never emitted: replacing a bucket or a SQL instance destroys
 * data, so drift on an immutable field is reported as a diagnostic for a human.
 *
 * Long-running Operations are the honesty problem specific to GCP. Cloud SQL
 * and Cloud Run answer a create with an `Operation` whose `done` is `false`;
 * the resource is *not* ready, and reading that as a finished create is the
 * worst failure mode available here. So this module polls the operation to a
 * terminal state through the same injected transport, under a **bounded,
 * injected** poll budget (`operationPoll`) — no clock, no unbounded loop — and
 * when the budget runs out without a terminal answer it says so in
 * `diagnostics`: accepted, not confirmed. A `delete()` that cannot be confirmed
 * raises rather than returning quietly, because on that path silence *is* the
 * success report and there is no diagnostics channel to qualify it.
 *
 * Pub/Sub, Secret Manager and Cloud Tasks answer a second create with
 * `409 ALREADY_EXISTS`. That is a usable convergence signal, but only *after* a
 * GET: create-and-swallow-409 would hide a real conflict (someone else's
 * resource under our name) behind a shrug, so the 409 path re-reads and adopts
 * what it finds instead of assuming it is ours.
 *
 * Credentials are locators, never material. A resolver is constructed with an
 * injected `resolveCredential(ref)`; `ResolveRequest.credentialRef` must be a
 * `scheme://…` locator — the grammar core's `parseResolveRequest` enforces — and
 * a value that looks like the OAuth2 access token itself is refused, because a
 * raw token in a request record is a token in the event log. The token reaches
 * exactly one place: the `authorization` header. It is never logged, never put
 * in `outputs`, and Google's error text is redacted before it reaches a message.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`, a clock, or a random source.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE (also in the README):
 *   - These resolvers are exercised against an *injected fake* transport.
 *     Nothing in this package proves a live deploy: that additionally needs
 *     real credentials, real network egress, and a real Google Cloud project,
 *     none of which a unit test supplies.
 *   - The endpoint paths, request bodies and response field names below are
 *     written from Google's published REST documentation. They have not been
 *     replayed against the running services, so a field Google has since
 *     renamed would fail at deploy time, not here.
 *   - Coverage is a slice of each product's API — enough to allocate, observe,
 *     converge and remove — and explicitly not the whole surface. Products with
 *     no convergent path ship no resolver at all; they are named in
 *     {@link GCP_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS} with the reason.
 *   - The `productId` strings are read off the `./slots.js` factories, so the
 *     registry and the Yard catalog cannot drift apart. Whether a matching
 *     Resource Definition is registered is still checked at resolution time
 *     (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`), not here.

 * product is a *served site*, and `cdn: true` additionally needs a backend
 * bucket, a URL map, a target proxy and a forwarding rule on
 * `compute.googleapis.com`. Shipping only the bucket half would silently
 * under-deliver the product.
