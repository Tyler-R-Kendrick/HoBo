/**
 * The default Hetzner Yard catalog: what Hetzner *can* allocate, per slot.
 *
 * A Yard declares allocatable capacity. It is not a mapping, not a pool, not a
 * selection, and not a record of what an app uses — so a slot holds a *list*,
 * and several entries in one slot are the normal case, with selection
 * (ADR-0151) picking among them later against the requirements the app
 * actually states. Collapsing a slot to a single value would quietly make this
 * module the selector, which is exactly the decision the Yard is not allowed to
 * take.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — how full this catalog is: it is built strictly from the typed
 * factories `./slots.ts` ships, and it is deliberately narrow because Hetzner
 * is deliberately narrow. Five slots the hyperscaler catalogs carry are absent
 * rather than filled with a near-miss: Hetzner sells no managed database, no
 * managed cache, no managed queue, no managed topic and no managed secret
 * store, so `data`, `kv`, `queue`, `topic` and `secretRef` have no rows. An
 * empty slot is a gap an author can see; a row pointing at "Postgres you
 * install yourself on a Cloud Server" would be a portability lie.
 *
 * `hetznerYardSpec()` emits raw row-shaped data rather than a `Yard`: this is a
 * layer-2 provider package, so it may import `@hobo/core` and nothing else HoBo
 * — `@hobo/yards` (layer 3) is the package that parses these rows into a
 * canonical, deduplicated set. The rows are sorted by
 * `(profile, productId, connectivityId)`, the same canonical order
 * `parseYardBindings` imposes, so the hand-off is byte-stable.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock, no randomness, no environment reads. Two calls with
 * the same options are deep-equal.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — what deploys: this package registers no Resource Definitions
 * for the `hetzner.*` product ids, so a deploy attempted against this Yard
 * fails closed at resolution (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`) until definitions
 * land. It does ship resolvers, but for 4 of the 5 ids only
 * (`HETZNER_RESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS`), and those are proven against an injected
 * fake transport — no live Hetzner call has been made from this repo.
