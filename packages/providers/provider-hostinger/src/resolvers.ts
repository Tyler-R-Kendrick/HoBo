/**
 * Direct Hostinger API resource resolvers — the default deployment path.
 *
 * Why this module exists, and what makes it different from the other provider
 * packages: on AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean and Hetzner, "allocate a resource" is an
 * API call. **On Hostinger it is a purchase.** A VPS, a hosting plan and the
 * MySQL database that comes with it are all obtained by placing a billing
 * order; the API manages instances you already own. That is not a gap in
 * Hostinger's API, it is the shape of the product, and this module is written
 * around it rather than pretending otherwise.
 *
 * So these resolvers **adopt and converge**. `reconcile()` finds the instance
 * you already bought, brings its mutable state to what the request asks for,
 * and reports what it found. When there is nothing to adopt it raises a typed
 * refusal naming the purchase as the missing step — it does not place the
 * order. That refusal is enforced by the transport, not just by this code: the
 * guard in `./transport.ts` does not allowlist `/api/billing/v1/`, so a future
 * edit here cannot quietly start spending the account's money without also
 * widening the policy in a way a reviewer sees.
 *
 * Everything else is the usual convergence contract. `reconcile()` reads before
 * it writes, running it twice yields the same `physicalId` and exactly one
 * mutation, `delete()` treats "already gone" as success, and `"replace"` is
 * never emitted — reinstalling a VPS destroys its disk, so drift on an
 * immutable field is reported as a diagnostic and left for a human.
 *
 * One thing this module refuses on purpose: a root password in `desired`.
 * Hostinger's VPS setup call accepts one, and accepting it here would put
 * credential material in a `ResolveRequest`, which is material in the event
 * log. Setup is expressed with an SSH public-key *id* instead — a reference to
 * a key already uploaded to the account, which is a locator rather than a
 * secret.
 *
 * Credentials are locators, never material. A resolver is constructed with an
 * injected `resolveCredential(ref)`; `ResolveRequest.credentialRef` must be a
 * `scheme://…` locator — the grammar core's `parseResolveRequest` enforces —
 * and a value that looks like the API token itself is refused. The token
 * reaches exactly one place: the `authorization` header. It is never logged,
 * never put in `outputs`, and Hostinger's error text is redacted before it
 * reaches a message.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock, no randomness, no environment reads.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE (also in the README):
 *   - These resolvers are exercised against an *injected fake* transport
 *     modelling a Hostinger account. Nothing in this package proves a live
 *     deploy: that additionally needs a real token, real network egress, and a
 *     real Hostinger account with plans already purchased.
 *   - The endpoint paths, request bodies and response field names below are
 *     written from Hostinger's published API reference. They have not been
 *     replayed against the running service, so a field Hostinger has since
 *     renamed would fail at deploy time, not here.
 *   - 2 of the 5 catalogued products have resolvers. The other three are named
 *     in {@link HOSTINGER_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS} with the reason.
 *   - The `productId` strings are read off the `./slots.js` factories, so the
 *     registry and the Yard catalog cannot drift apart.
