/**
 * Typed Hostinger offering factories for Yard slot bindings.
 *
 * Why this module exists: authoring a slot binding by hand means typing a
 * capability-profile string, a product id, and an untyped property bag — three
 * independent chances to make a typo that only surfaces at resolution time.
 * Each factory here owns exactly one `(slot, profile, productId)` triple and
 * takes a per-product options interface, so the profile string is never typed
 * by an operator and a misspelled option name is a compile error.
 *
 * Every factory returns `slotBinding()` from `@hobo/core`; none of them build a
 * binding record by hand. The core parse boundary — credential screening,
 * JSON-safety, freezing, key ordering — therefore applies to every binding
 * produced here, and this module adds no parse rules of its own.
 *
 * No defaults are invented. A default plan or PHP version quietly deployed on
 * the caller's behalf would misreport what they asked for, so an omitted option
 * is simply absent from `properties` and the Resource Definition decides.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — the shape of this provider: Hostinger sells *hosting plans*,
 * not raw infrastructure primitives. The products below are the things a plan
 * gives you: a VPS you administer, shared/cloud web hosting that serves PHP, a
 * MySQL database that comes with the plan, and DNS for a domain you own. There
 * is no object store, no managed cache and no managed queue in this list
 * because Hostinger sells none, so the `bucket`, `kv`, `queue` and `topic`
 * slots stay empty rather than being filled with a near-miss.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — allocation is a purchase: every product here is allocated by
 * *buying a plan*, and the Hostinger API manages instances you already own
 * rather than ordering new ones. The resolvers in `./resolvers.ts` therefore
 * adopt-and-converge rather than create, and refuse the create path with
 * remediation instead of quietly placing a billing order. See that module.

/**
 * Forwards the caller's option bag to the parse boundary, dropping only keys
 * whose value is `undefined` (an omitted option must be absent, not an
 * explicit `undefined`, under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and JSON-safety).
 *
 * Every remaining key is passed through — including one the option types do
 * not declare — so a key smuggled past the types reaches `slotBinding()` and
 * is screened there. Cherry-picking the known keys instead would silently
 * swallow it, which is exactly the kind of quiet drop this repo refuses.
