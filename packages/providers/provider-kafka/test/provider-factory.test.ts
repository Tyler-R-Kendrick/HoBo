/**
 * The Kafka provider factory and its realize path.
 *
 * The factory's job is to resolve three things once — the tenant, the cluster,
 * and the transport — and then hand them to every later call so a caller does
 * not have to repeat them. Each of those defaults has a failure mode worth
 * naming.
 *
 * The **tenant** scopes every topic and consumer group derived from the
 * cluster, so a default that leaked between providers would put one tenant's
 * traffic in another's namespace. The **cluster** default is a local Redpanda,
 * which is the right shape for a first run but must be overridable without
 * ceremony. The **transport** is resolved from the environment exactly once, at
 * construction, so a later change to `process.env` cannot silently repoint a
 * provider that is already wired — and a per-call override must not persist
 * into the next call.
 *
 * `realize` is where the parse boundary gets exercised in anger: topics inherit
 * the cluster's name and tenant when they do not state their own, which is what
 * makes a terse topic list authorable without inviting a topic that belongs to
 * a different cluster than the one it was declared under.
