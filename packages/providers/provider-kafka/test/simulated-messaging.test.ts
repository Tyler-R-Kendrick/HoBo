/**
 * The simulated-fidelity messaging surface.
 *
 * `createKafkaMessaging` has two paths. The live one drives a real broker
 * transport; the simulated one runs in memory so a Bindle can be authored and
 * exercised with no cluster at all. Both implement the same `KafkaMessaging`
 * shape, and that is exactly where the risk is: a simulated client that
 * silently diverged from the live one would let a developer build against
 * semantics the broker does not have, and the divergence would surface only
 * once something was deployed.
 *
 * So the property that matters most here is **honesty about which path you are
 * on**. The simulated client reports `fidelity: "simulated"` and a `null`
 * transport, and every metering fact it emits carries that label — a consumer
 * reading usage cannot mistake in-memory traffic for broker traffic. The
 * partition count it reports is likewise a plausible default rather than a
 * measurement, because there is no cluster to measure.
