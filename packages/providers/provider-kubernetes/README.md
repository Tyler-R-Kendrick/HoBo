# @hobo/provider-kubernetes

Kubernetes CloudProvider for HoBo, at the same structural parity as the
hyperscaler providers: an equivalence map from the `compute` port onto a
Deployment, a full allocatable Yard catalog of built-in objects, convergent
`ResourceResolver`s for them, an injected-transport apiserver driver that places
a workload on a real cluster, and the temporary/agent Environment Station
contract.

```sh
pnpm --filter @hobo/provider-kubernetes test
```

## Two lanes to a cluster

This package has two paths, and the difference matters:

| | Driver (`provisionWorkload`) | Resolvers (`kubernetesResolvers`) |
|---|---|---|
| Shape | one opinionated sequence: Namespace → Deployment → Service | one convergent `reconcile` per built-in object |
| Transport | this package's `KubernetesTransport` | `@hobo/core`'s `HttpTransport` (the `ResourceResolver` contract) |
| `kubectl proxy` | **supported**, behind an explicit opt-in | **not supported** — core's guard is HTTPS-only |
| Used by | `hobo deploy` placement | the Yard resolution path |

Neither replaces the other. What did change: `realize()` now emits the canonical
`hobo.iac-program/v1` document `@hobo/core`'s `CloudProvider` contract requires
and every other provider emits. The provider-shaped driver document it used to
return had no executor in the repo; it is still reachable as
`kubernetesDriverProgram()`, because it names the apply path the driver
implements.

## What this package does

- **Equivalence → default Resource Definitions** (`EQUIVALENCE_CLASSES` /
  `createKubernetesProvider`), with Matching's `satisfies` answering
  full/partial/none rather than fabricating parity.
- **A default Yard catalog** (`kubernetesYardSpec()`): Deployment, Service,
  Ingress, Job, CronJob, PersistentVolumeClaim and a Secret *locator* row, as
  canonical rows `@hobo/yards` parses.
- **Convergent resolvers** (`kubernetesResolvers()`) for six of those seven
  products: read-or-create against the apiserver, merge-patch on drift, and
  "already gone" as a successful delete.
- **`realize()` → `hobo.iac-program/v1`** for the primary Pulumi lane, plus the
  published Capability Manifest with declared cost facts and the projected
  ServiceAccount token posture.
- **Placement on a cluster.** `parseWorkloadPlacement` refines an authored
  option bag; `createKubernetesApiClient` creates the Namespace, Deployment and
  ClusterIP Service through an injected HTTP transport; `provisionWorkload`
  orders those three and returns a receipt.
- **Rollout truth.** `observeRollout` reads the Deployment's `/status`
  subresource and reports the phase the controller's own generation and
  conditions support.
- **Teardown that stops at what it created.** `cleanupWorkload` deletes only a
  namespace this driver created, and reports `deleting` — not `deleted` — until
  it has observed the namespace gone.
- **Temporary/agent Environment Stations:**
  `supportsAnonymousTemporaryDeploy = true`, provisioned through an
  injectable/local transport with no permanent API tokens.

## One equivalence class, a wider catalog

The cross-cloud equivalence table has one row — compute, on a Deployment —
because Kubernetes natively provides compute and nothing else in HoBo's port
vocabulary. Databases, caches, queues and object stores arrive through
*operators*: third-party software an operator installs, which this package
cannot see, let alone install. So `data`, `kv`, `queue` and `topic` have no Yard
rows, and an app that needs Postgres gets a truthful `none` here.

The Yard catalog is wider than the equivalence table, and that is not a
contradiction: a Job, an Ingress and a PersistentVolumeClaim are real
allocatable built-in objects, but they are not rows of the *cross-cloud* table,
which maps capability ports onto a provider's headline products.

## Three deliberate refusals in the resolvers

1. **The namespace is never defaulted.** A fallback to `default` would put a
   workload in the busiest namespace in most clusters — the one where an RBAC
   mistake reaches everything. `desired.namespace` is required.
2. **`"replace"` is never emitted.** A Job's pod template and a PVC's storage
   class are immutable; converging them means deleting the object, which for a
   PVC destroys data and for a Job discards a completed run. Drift is reported
   as a diagnostic.
3. **A Secret's contents never touch `desired`.** They arrive through the
   injected `resolveSecretData(logicalId)`, the same shape as every other
   credential in this repo — core refuses credential-shaped keys in a property
   bag precisely because `desired` is recorded in the event log. From there the
   discipline is mechanical and tested: material is fetched immediately before
   the call and held no longer; it goes into the request body and nowhere else;
   outputs publish the *key names*, the object `type` and the `k8s://` locator,
   never a value; and a rotation converges by comparing encoded values in
   memory, so neither version is rendered into a diagnostic. The output keys are
   deliberately named `objectType` and `locator` rather than `secretType` and
   `secretRef`, because core refuses credential-shaped keys in an outcome's
   outputs too — and is right to.

## Honest scope for the resolver lane

- **No live cluster is proven.** The resolvers are exercised against an injected
  fake transport modelling an apiserver. A real deploy additionally needs a
  cluster, credentials and network egress.
- **No `kubectl proxy`.** See the two-lanes table above.
- **No Resource Definitions are registered** for the `kubernetes.*` product ids,
  so a deploy routed through the *Yard* still fails closed at resolution
  (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`).
- **Built-ins only.** Anything an operator installs — a Postgres CRD, a queue
  CRD — is out of scope by construction, not by omission.

## What it does not do

- **No kubeconfig, no credential handling.** The host supplies a
  `KubernetesTransport` that already authenticates. Nothing here reads
  `~/.kube/config`, and nothing here holds a bearer token.
- **No ingress, no LoadBalancer, no external address.** The receipt carries an
  in-cluster `http://<svc>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local:80` URL, because that is the
  only object this provider created. Advertising an external hostname would be
  claiming something it never provisioned.
- **No waiting.** `observeRollout` reads once. A driver that polls owns a
  deadline, a backoff and a cancellation story, and all three belong to the
  caller that knows what the deploy is for.
- **No deletion of anything it adopted.** An adopted namespace was the
  operator's before this deploy existed and holds objects nobody here
  enumerated.

## Parse, don't validate

Nothing in this package re-checks a value it already accepted. Untrusted input
crosses one parser and comes out as a **derived domain type** that cannot hold
the bad case:

- `parseWorkloadPlacement` turns the untrusted `.with(kubernetes.workload(...))`
  option bag into a `WorkloadPlacement`: an RFC 1123 name and namespace, a
  registry-qualified image with a tag or digest, bounded replicas, and CPU and
  memory already normalized to millicores and bytes. Kubernetes quantities are a
  suffix language — `250m`, `0.25`, `1M`, `1Mi` — and comparing them as written
  is how a limit ends up below its request. `parseCpuMillicores` and
  `parseMemoryBytes` are the only code that reads a suffix; everything
  downstream compares integers.
- `parseNamespaceRecord`, `parseDeploymentRecord` and `parseServiceRecord` turn
  apiserver JSON into records whose fields are already checked: UID-shaped uids,
  opaque `resourceVersion` tokens, a Namespace phase from the documented pair, a
  routable ClusterIP (a headless `None` is rejected, because a record built from
  one would promise an endpoint that does not exist).
- `rolloutPhaseFor` collapses a generation, an observed generation, four replica
  counters and a condition list into one of `pending | progressing | available |
  failed`. A `ProgressDeadlineExceeded` rollout whose old replicas are still
  serving reports every counter as healthy; the phase is `failed` anyway, and
  `available` is unreachable unless the controller has observed the current
  generation.
- `parseApiStatus` reads the apiserver's own `kind: "Status"` envelope, so a 409
  `AlreadyExists` (adopt the namespace) can be told apart from a 409 `Conflict`
  (stale resourceVersion), which want opposite responses.
- `NamespaceRecord.createdByHobo` makes "we created this" a field rather than an
  assumption. It is what `cleanupWorkload` reads before issuing a DELETE.

`data-models/provider_kubernetes.proto` is the design-time wire view of these
shapes and `data-models/provider_kubernetes.cue` carries the invariants the
parsers enforce (DNS-1123 labels, replica and port ranges, limit ≥ request,
`available` implying an observed current generation, retention naming its
reason). The parsed types above are the executable view of that pair.

## Contracts

`contracts/provider-kubernetes-apiserver.pact.json` is the consumer-driven
contract for the core/v1 and apps/v1 surfaces this package calls;
`test/contract.test.ts` replays every interaction through the real client with
the fake at the HTTP seam and nowhere else. See
[`contracts/README.md`](contracts/README.md).

## Event architecture

This package is a strategy leaf: it holds no reducer, no stream, and no store.
Its job is to turn one apiserver interaction into facts a durable plane can
record, and that machinery lives in the deploy/claim planes, not here.

The flow for one placement:

1. A **command** from the deploy family — `PlaceWorkload`, `ObserveRollout`,
   `ReleaseWorkload` — is what a caller issues. `provisionWorkload`,
   `observeRollout` and `cleanupWorkload` are the effectful halves those
   commands invoke.
2. Each returns an observation, not a durable fact: a `ProvisionReceipt`, a
   `DeploymentRecord`, a `CleanupOutcome`. The deploy coordinator **actor** is
   what turns them into the **events** `WorkloadPlaced`, `NamespaceAdopted`,
   `RolloutObserved`, `RolloutFailed` and `WorkloadReleased`.
3. That actor appends the command and its events to the durable **event store**
   on the `deploy:<deploymentRef>` stream under an optimistic `expectedSeq`. The
   records here are designed to be appendable: they carry names, uids,
   `resourceVersion` tokens, counters and instants, and never a token, a
   kubeconfig or a Secret payload.
4. Folding that journal back yields a **snapshot** of the placement — the
   namespace's ownership flag, the last observed generation, the last rollout
   phase — which the next append fences against, and which is what makes a
   repeated deploy adopt rather than duplicate.
5. The rollout **projection** over that snapshot is the **materialized view**
   `hobo deploy status` renders, and it is the **read store** for the endpoint
   URL and phase. It cannot report a placement healthy while the last observed
   phase is `failed`, and it cannot report a namespace released while the last
   `CleanupOutcome` was `deleting`.

The distinction step 5 depends on is the one this package is careful about:
`deleting` is an acceptance, `deleted` is an observation, and only the second
one may retire a placement from the read model.

## Error codes

`KubernetesProviderError.code` is one of `PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED`,
`PROVIDER_CONTRACT_CHANGED`, `PROVIDER_OPERATION_AMBIGUOUS`,
`PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED`, `PROVISIONING_CONFLICT`, `PLACEMENT_REJECTED`,
`ROLLOUT_FAILED`, `CLEANUP_INCOMPLETE`.

A 5xx on a create is `PROVIDER_OPERATION_AMBIGUOUS`, never a retryable error: a
timed-out POST never proves the apiserver did nothing. Every message and detail
passes `redactClusterText`, because a `Status` message quotes the object that
caused it and those objects carry ServiceAccount tokens and imagePullSecrets.
