/**
 * The default Kubernetes Yard catalog: what a cluster *can* allocate, per slot.
 *
 * A Yard declares allocatable capacity. It is not a mapping, not a pool, not a
 * selection, and not a record of what an app uses — so a slot holds a *list*,
 * and several entries in one slot are the normal case, with selection
 * (ADR-0151) picking among them later against the requirements the app
 * actually states. Collapsing a slot to a single value would quietly make this
 * module the selector, which is exactly the decision the Yard is not allowed to
 * take.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — how full this catalog is: it is built strictly from the typed
 * factories `./slots.ts` ships, and every one of those is a *built-in*
 * Kubernetes object reachable from any conformant apiserver. Four slots the
 * hyperscaler catalogs carry are absent rather than filled with a near-miss:
 * Kubernetes provides no database, cache, queue or topic, so `data`, `kv`,
 * `queue` and `topic` have no rows. Those capabilities arrive through
 * operators — third-party software an operator installs into the cluster — and
 * a row for one would be a claim about software this package cannot see, let
 * alone install.
 *
 * `kubernetesYardSpec()` emits raw row-shaped data rather than a `Yard`: this
 * is a layer-2 provider package, so it may import `@hobo/core` and nothing else
 * HoBo — `@hobo/yards` (layer 3) is the package that parses these rows into a
 * canonical, deduplicated set. The rows are sorted by
 * `(profile, productId, connectivityId)`, the same canonical order
 * `parseYardBindings` imposes, so the hand-off is byte-stable.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock, no randomness, no environment reads. Two calls with
 * the same options are deep-equal.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — what deploys: unlike the SaaS providers in this repo, this
 * package does reach a real apiserver — `provisionWorkload` in `./driver.ts`
 * creates a Namespace, a Deployment and a Service through an injected
 * transport, and `./resolvers.ts` reconciles built-in objects one at a time.
 * What is still true is that no Resource Definitions are registered for the
 * `kubernetes.*` product ids, so a deploy attempted through the *Yard* fails
 * closed at resolution (`YARD_BINDING_PRODUCT_UNKNOWN`) until they land, and
 * every test here runs against an injected fake transport rather than a live
 * cluster. Eight of the nine catalogued products have resolvers; the ninth is
 * the Secret, for the reason `./slots.ts` gives.
