/**
 * Direct apiserver resource resolvers for built-in Kubernetes objects.
 *
 * Why this module exists: this package shipped a *placement driver* — one
 * opinionated sequence that creates a Namespace, a Deployment and a Service for
 * a web workload — and no `ResourceResolver`, so a deploy routed through a Yard
 * failed closed for want of one. These resolvers close that gap: one convergent
 * `reconcile` per built-in object, talking to the apiserver over an injected,
 * guarded `HttpTransport`, with no IaC engine and no state file in the middle.
 * The driver in `./driver.ts` stays exactly as it was; it is the opinionated
 * path, this is the general one.
 *
 * The property that makes that safe is **convergence**, and Kubernetes makes it
 * unusually easy: every object here has a deterministic name inside a
 * namespace, so "does it already exist" is a single GET rather than a listing.
 * `reconcile()` reads first, creates only when the read says absent, and then
 * applies the mutable delta as a merge patch. Running it twice yields the same
 * `physicalId`, exactly one object, and exactly one create call. `delete()`
 * treats "already gone" as success for the same reason.
 *
 * Three deliberate refusals, each of which would otherwise be a plausible
 * convenience:
 *
 * 1. **The namespace is never defaulted.** A resolver that quietly fell back to
 *    `default` would put a workload in the busiest namespace in the cluster,
 *    where an RBAC mistake reaches everything. `desired.namespace` is required
 *    and its absence is a typed refusal naming the fix.
 * 2. **`"replace"` is never emitted.** A Job's pod template and a PVC's storage
 *    class are immutable, and "converging" them means deleting the object —
 *    which for a PVC deletes data and for a Job discards a completed run. Drift
 *    on an immutable field is reported as a diagnostic for a human.
 * 3. **Secrets ship no resolver at all.** Creating one means putting its
 *    contents in `desired`, and `desired` is recorded in the event log. The
 *    catalog still declares `kubernetes.secret/v1` as a *locator* row, which is
 *    the whole point of that profile — see
 *    {@link KUBERNETES_UNRESOLVED_PRODUCT_IDS}.
 *
 * Credentials are locators, never material. A resolver is constructed with an
 * injected `resolveCredential(ref)`; `ResolveRequest.credentialRef` must be a
 * `scheme://…` locator — the grammar core's `parseResolveRequest` enforces —
 * and a value that looks like a bearer token is refused, because a raw token in
 * a request record is a token in the event log. The token reaches exactly one
 * place: the `authorization` header. Apiserver `Status` text is passed through
 * `redactClusterText` before it reaches a message, because a Status routinely
 * quotes the object that caused it and those objects carry tokens.
 *
 * Determinism: no clock, no randomness, no environment reads.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE (also in the README):
 *   - These resolvers are exercised against an *injected fake* transport
 *     modelling an apiserver. Nothing in this package proves a live deploy:
 *     that additionally needs a real cluster, real credentials and real network
 *     egress, none of which a unit test supplies.
 *   - They do **not** support `kubectl proxy`. The `ResourceResolver` contract
 *     runs over `@hobo/core`'s HTTPS-only transport guard; the cleartext
 *     loopback escape lives on the driver path and deliberately not here. See
 *     `./resolver-transport.ts`.
 *   - Coverage is the built-in objects named below and explicitly not the whole
 *     API. Anything an operator installs — a Postgres CRD, a queue CRD — is out
 *     of scope by construction, not by omission.
 *   - The `productId` strings are read off the `./slots.js` factories, so the
 *     registry and the Yard catalog cannot drift apart.

 * this reason, so the contents arrive through the injected
 * `resolveSecretData(logicalId)` — the same shape as every other credential in
 * this repo — and `desired` carries only the Secret's `type` and its labels.
 *
 * From there the discipline is mechanical, and each piece is tested:
 *
 *   - material is fetched immediately before the call and held no longer;
 *   - it goes into the request body and nowhere else — never an output, never a
 *     diagnostic, never a URL, never an error message;
 *   - outputs publish the *key names* and the type, because a binding needs to
 *     know a Secret has a `password` key, and never the values;
 *   - drift is decided by comparing encoded values in memory, so a rotation
 *     converges without either version being rendered anywhere.
