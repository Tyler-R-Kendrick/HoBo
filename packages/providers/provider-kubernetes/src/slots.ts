/**
 * Typed Kubernetes offering factories for Yard slot bindings.
 *
 * Why this module exists: authoring a slot binding by hand means typing a
 * capability-profile string, a product id, and an untyped property bag — three
 * independent chances to make a typo that only surfaces at resolution time.
 * Each factory here owns exactly one `(slot, profile, productId)` triple and
 * takes a per-product options interface, so the profile string is never typed
 * by an operator and a misspelled option name is a compile error.
 *
 * Every factory returns `slotBinding()` from `@hobo/core`; none of them build a
 * binding record by hand. The core parse boundary — credential screening,
 * JSON-safety, freezing, key ordering — therefore applies to every binding
 * produced here, and this module adds no parse rules of its own.
 *
 * No defaults are invented. A default replica count or storage size quietly
 * deployed on the caller's behalf would misreport what they asked for, so an
 * omitted option is simply absent from `properties` and the Resource
 * Definition decides.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE — what a cluster is, and is not: every product below is a
 * *built-in* Kubernetes object, reachable from the apiserver of any conformant
 * cluster. There is no database, cache, queue or object store here, because
 * Kubernetes provides none: those arrive through operators, which are
 * third-party software an operator installs, not something the Kubernetes API
 * offers. A `kubernetes.postgres/v1` row would be a claim about software this
 * package cannot see, let alone install, so the `data`, `kv`, `queue` and
 * `topic` slots stay empty.
 */

/**
 * Forwards the caller's option bag to the parse boundary, dropping only keys
 * whose value is `undefined` (an omitted option must be absent, not an
 * explicit `undefined`, under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and JSON-safety).
 *
 * Every remaining key is passed through — including one the option types do
 * not declare — so a key smuggled past the types reaches `slotBinding()` and
 * is screened there. Cherry-picking the known keys instead would silently
 * swallow it, which is exactly the kind of quiet drop this repo refuses.
