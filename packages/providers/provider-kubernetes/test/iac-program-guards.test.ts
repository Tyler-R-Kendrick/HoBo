/**
 * The local IacProgram guard: the emit side's parse boundary.
 *
 * This provider cannot import `@hobo/iac-pulumi` — the package boundary forbids
 * adapter-to-adapter runtime edges — so `iac-program.ts` keeps a local mirror of
 * that adapter's program shape, and `assertLocalIacProgram` is what proves the
 * mirror still matches. It is the only thing standing between `realize()` and
 * emitting a program the real `validateIacProgram` would reject, which is a
 * failure that would otherwise surface at `pulumi up` — after credentials, after
 * a stack is selected, and a long way from the resolver that built the bad
 * reference.
 *
 * **Output references are the part worth the effort.** The three header fields
 * are a version check anyone would write. But `${resources.<name>.outputs.<key>}`
 * is a cross-resource pointer that the emit side constructs by string
 * concatenation, and there are two distinct ways to get it wrong: naming a
 * resource that is not in the program, and naming an output that resource does
 * not declare. Both produce a program that is structurally perfect and
 * un-deployable, and the guard has to catch each one — including references
 * buried inside nested resource inputs, since that is where resolvers actually
 * put them.
 *
 * **A string that merely looks like a reference is not one.** The guard only
 * inspects values starting with `${resources.`, so ordinary configuration
 * strings pass through untouched. That distinction is tested in both directions:
 * a plain string is left alone, and a malformed `${resources.` string is
 * refused rather than quietly ignored.
 *
 * Written against only the three shared exports, so the same file stands in
 * every provider that carries this mirror.
