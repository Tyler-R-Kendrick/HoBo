/**
 * The optional flags on the pg_dump and pg_restore command lines.
 *
 * `migration.test.ts` covers the security half of argv construction — the fused
 * `--flag=value` form, the NUL/newline refusal, the credential-shaped-material
 * refusal, and the rule that a password only ever travels in the environment.
 * This covers the other half: which flags actually end up on the line, which is
 * what decides whether a migration moves the schema, the rows, or both.
 *
 * **Schema-only and data-only are mutually exclusive, and the refusal is the
 * point.** `pg_dump` given both produces an empty dump rather than an error, so
 * a migration built that way would report success and restore nothing. Catching
 * it here means the contradiction is reported against the spec that expressed
 * it rather than discovered when the restore comes up empty.
 *
 * **Absent is not false.** Every optional flag is spread on `=== true`, so a
 * spec that omits one contributes nothing to the line. That matters because
 * these are booleans arriving from callers and config: a flag emitted for any
 * truthy value would put `--data-only` on a line because someone wrote
 * `dataOnly: "no"`.
 *
 * **`--no-owner` travels with `--no-acl`.** They are one decision — restore
 * into a database whose ownership and grants differ from the source — and
 * emitting only one produces a restore that fails partway on permissions it
 * was told not to care about.
