/**
 * The Node `child_process` adapter behind the CLI seam.
 *
 * This is the one place in the adapter that starts an operating-system
 * process, and the security property is stated in the source: `shell` is left
 * at `false` and the argv is split into file-plus-arguments, so **no part of
 * it is ever parsed by a shell**. Site names, deploy messages and directory
 * paths all reach this function from user input; with `shell: true` a name
 * containing `;` or `$(…)` would execute. The tests below run real processes
 * to prove that end-to-end rather than asserting the option in isolation.
 *
 * The output cap is the other guard. The CLI's output is unbounded from this
 * package's point of view, and a runaway process would otherwise accumulate
 * into a string until the host ran out of memory. The cap *rejects* rather
 * than returning truncated output, because a truncated deploy log parsed as
 * though it were complete is how a claim URL goes missing without anyone
 * noticing.
 *
 * Every process here is `process.execPath` — the Node binary already running
 * these tests — so nothing depends on a toolchain the machine might not have.
