/**
 * The product definition the catalog selects over.
 *
 * ttl.sh is an **artifact transport**, and the whole point of writing its
 * definition carefully is that it must never read as hosting. It stores no
 * application state, grants no ownership, issues no credential, and answers to
 * nobody once the TTL runs out. The declaration says exactly that:
 *
 * - `claimActionCount: 0` and a `none-expire` claim mode. There is no ceremony
 *   because there is nothing to take ownership *of* — no account, no console,
 *   no transfer. A definition with even one claim action would be advertising a
 *   path that does not exist.
 * - `retain-until-provider-expiry` cleanup. There is no delete endpoint. The
 *   only teardown is the registry's own reaper, and pretending otherwise would
 *   make a cleanup failure look like a HoBo bug instead of a documented fact.
 * - `bucket.oci-artifact-transport/v1`, refining `bucket.content-addressed/v1`.
 *   That is honest about what it is — immutable digest-addressed bytes over
 *   HTTPS — and it deliberately claims nothing in the `web`, `api`, or `data`
 *   families, so a requirement for hosting can never resolve to this.
 *
 * Every fact below is either documented by ttl.sh and dated, or absent. Absent
 * beats optimistic: an unset structured capability fails a `required` feature
 * gate, which is the correct outcome for something nobody has verified.
