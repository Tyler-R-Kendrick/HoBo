/**
 * Promotion: getting the artifact somewhere it will still exist tomorrow.
 *
 * This is the only exit from `none-expire`. It is a digest-to-digest copy into a
 * registry the operator controls, and it is deliberately not called "claim" or
 * "adopt": nothing about it changes the artifact's status on ttl.sh, which keeps
 * expiring on schedule. What changes is that a second, owned copy exists.
 *
 * Three refusals are load-bearing:
 *
 * - the destination cannot be another anonymous expiring registry
 *   (`parseOwnerControlledRegistry`), because that is a lifetime extension wearing
 *   ownership's clothes;
 * - the source lease must still be live, checked against the caller's clock reading
 *   before a tool is spawned, because a promotion that starts after expiry copies
 *   nothing and reports a tool error rather than the truth;
 * - an artifact pushed under an acknowledgement must be promoted into the registry
 *   that acknowledgement named, or the acknowledgement was decorative.
 *
 * The copy is verified by digest afterwards. On a registry where anyone may push
 * over a name, "the source now resolves to something else" is a scenario with a
 * mechanism behind it rather than a hypothetical.
