/**
 * The push path, expressed as a port.
 *
 * Pushing an image is the one genuinely effectful thing this package does, and
 * the obvious implementation — shell out to whatever CLI is on PATH — is the
 * one that cannot be tested, cannot be reasoned about, and quietly inherits the
 * ambient Docker credentials of whoever ran it. So the effect is an injected
 * {@link OciPushExecutor}, and the shell-out is one implementation of it:
 *
 * - Every external command is an argv array handed to an injected
 *   {@link ProcessRunner}. There is no shell, no string concatenation, no
 *   interpolation. A name containing `; rm -rf /` cannot reach here (the
 *   reference parser refuses it) and would still be one inert argv element.
 * - The binary and every flag come from an allowlist. A caller cannot pass
 *   `--insecure` — dropping TLS to an anonymous registry means the artifact is
 *   both unauthenticated *and* interceptible — and cannot pass any of the
 *   credential-bearing flags, because there is no credential to pass.
 * - {@link assertArgvSafe} is the last line of defence before a spawn, in the
 *   same shape `@hobo/provider-neon` uses for `pg_dump`.
 *
 * Idempotency is content-addressed rather than key-addressed. Two pushes of
 * the same digest to the same reference are the same push, and
 * {@link pushArtifact} adopts the recorded lease instead of spending a second
 * one. Two *different* digests under one reference is a refusal: a reference
 * whose content silently changed is a reference nobody can verify.
