/**
 * References, names, TTL windows, and expiry arithmetic.
 *
 * Three facts about ttl.sh drive everything in this module.
 *
 * **There are no accounts.** A repository name belongs to whoever pushed it last,
 * and anyone may pull anything they can name. The name is therefore the only thing
 * standing between an artifact and a stranger, which is why `parseArtifactName`
 * refuses anything guessable — `my-app`, `staging`, `hobo-build` — and accepts only
 * a minted UUID or a full content-addressed `sha256-<64 hex>` name. A friendly name
 * here is not a minor style问题; it is a public artifact with a predictable address.
 *
 * **The TTL is the tag.** `ttl.sh/<name>:1h` *means* "keep this for an hour". There
 * is no lifecycle API and nothing to reconcile: the lifetime is encoded in the
 * reference every consumer already holds. Documented range, checked 2026-08-08
 * against <https://ttl.sh/>: minutes up to a maximum of 24 hours, defaulting to 1h
 * when the tag omits one. This package never relies on that default — an
 * unspecified TTL is a rejected reference, because "whatever the service currently
 * defaults to" is not a lifetime an operator agreed to.
 *
 * **The registry reports no expiry.** So expiry is local arithmetic over the push
 * instant, which arrives as a parameter. Nothing here reads a clock.
