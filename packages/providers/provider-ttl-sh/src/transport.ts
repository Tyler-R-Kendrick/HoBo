/**
 * The registry HTTP boundary, as an injected port.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a global `fetch`. A host supplies a transport, and the
 * guard below is what makes any supplied transport safe: HTTPS only, one
 * allowlisted origin, the `/v2/` distribution surface only, no redirect chasing,
 * bounded body, bounded time.
 *
 * Two of the rules are specific to an anonymous registry and worth stating plainly.
 *
 * **No credential leaves this package.** The guard refuses to send `authorization`,
 * `proxy-authorization`, `cookie`, or `x-registry-auth`, and it refuses a URL with
 * userinfo in it. ttl.sh authenticates nobody, so a credential on a request to it
 * could only be an accident, and the cost of that accident is a secret mailed to a
 * public service. The refusal happens before the request leaves the process.
 *
 * **A 401 is a contract change, not a prompt.** There is no token exchange here and
 * no code path that could acquire one. Being challenged means the thing answering
 * is not the service this package was written against, and continuing would be
 * guessing.
 *
 * Everything else — including a 404, which is the registry's normal end state, and
 * a 429 — is returned to the caller to interpret through `ttlShErrorForStatus`.
