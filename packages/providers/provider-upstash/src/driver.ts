/**
 * The effectful driver for `upstash.temporary-redis/v1`.
 *
 * Four things this file is careful about:
 *
 * 1. **The token never leaves.** `provision` returns a record whose only
 *    credential-shaped field is a SecretRef. The plaintext exists inside one
 *    function scope and goes straight to custody.
 * 2. **Expiry is whatever the provider said.** There is no 72-hour timer here.
 *    If the response stops reporting an expiry, the record says so rather than
 *    substituting the documented number.
 * 3. **A claim is not complete when the expiry disappears.** The creating
 *    party still holds a working token afterwards, so the claim stays open on
 *    a blocking rotation ceremony until someone attests it happened.
 * 4. **There is no teardown.** This surface publishes no delete endpoint, so
 *    `destroy` refuses rather than pretending, except where expiry has already
 *    done the job.
