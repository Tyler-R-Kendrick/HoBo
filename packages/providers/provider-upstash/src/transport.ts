/**
 * The HTTP boundary, as an injected port.
 *
 * Nothing in this package reaches for a global `fetch`. A host supplies a
 * transport; the guard below is what makes any supplied transport safe. That
 * matters more here than usual, because the control-plane call is
 * unauthenticated and anonymous: there is no account, no API key, and
 * therefore nothing that would fail if the request went somewhere else. An
 * attacker-controlled origin would simply hand back a markdown document with
 * their token in it, and the driver would faithfully bind a workload to a
 * Redis the attacker can read.
 *
 * So: HTTPS only, allowlisted host, no redirect chasing, bounded body,
 * bounded time — and two separate policies, because the control plane and the
 * data plane are different origins with different rules.

 *   a clamp turns an authoring mistake into a mystery timeout — and this
 *   package's suite pins the clamp. Reconciling them is a behaviour change to
 *   argue on its own merits, not a side effect of consolidating a guard.
 * - Any 3xx is refused here; core lets a `Location`-less 3xx (a 304) through
 *   as an ordinary cache answer. Adopting core's rule would relax a refusal
 *   this driver currently makes.
