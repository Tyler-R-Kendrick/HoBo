/**
 * The sponsor-backed Vercel products the catalog selects over.
 *
 * These are *data*. The single most important fact they carry is that HoBo is
 * the initial owner and the cost bearer: `bootstrapStrategyRef` is
 * `bootstrap.vercel.sponsored/v1`, `bootstrapClass` on the lease is `sponsor`,
 * and `sponsorExposureMinorUnits` is greater than zero, which is what makes a
 * trust policy with `allowSponsor: false` or a zero sponsor budget reject them.
 *
 * Vercel is never classified as direct anonymous. Vercel Drop still requires a
 * Vercel account, so it is not an anonymous deployment path either; it lives in
 * `temporary-station.ts` and is deliberately not described by these
