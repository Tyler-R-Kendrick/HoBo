/**
 * Post-claim verification, revocation, and rotation.
 *
 * Two independent verifications, because there are two ownership facts:
 *
 *  - **the project** — a signed acceptance webhook (Vercel signs the callback
 *    with HMAC-SHA256 when `callbackSecret` is supplied) plus a read of
 *    `GET /v9/projects/{idOrName}`, whose `accountId` is the ownership fact;
 *  - **the associated database** — an injected probe against the resource's own
 *    provider. Vercel documents the verify/accept endpoints on the *integration
 *    server* side, not a claims-generator-side read, and after the transfer the
 *    sponsoring credential has no standing to ask. Inventing an endpoint here
 *    would produce a verification that always "passes".
 *
 * Then the sponsor's authority goes away and the database binding rotates,
 * because a claim where HoBo can still deploy or still read the database has
 * moved the invoice, not the ownership.
