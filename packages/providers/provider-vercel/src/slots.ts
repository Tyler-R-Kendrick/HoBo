/**
 * Typed slot factories for the Vercel Yard catalog (ADR-0157).
 *
 * A Yard declares what **can** be allocated on a provider — not what an app
 * uses, not a mapping, not a pool. These factories are the authoring surface
 * for that catalog: each one names one Vercel offering and returns the
 * `SlotBinding` record `@hobo/yards` compiles into a binding row. A slot may
 * carry several offerings; picking among them is selection's job, later, and
 * nothing here ranks or chooses.
 *
 * Why factories rather than hand-typed rows: a row is magic strings
 * (`{ profile: capability.web.hosted, productId: "vercel.project/v1" }`) with no
 * autocomplete and no type checking on the property bag. Each factory below has
 * its **own** options type — never `Record<string, unknown>` in the signature —
 * so a typo is a compile error rather than a deploy-time surprise.
 *
 * Every factory returns `slotBinding({…})` from `@hobo/core` rather than an
 * object literal, so core's parse boundary is the only way in: credential-shaped
 * property keys are refused, values must be JSON-safe, keys are sorted, and the
 * record comes back deep-frozen. The caller's whole option bag is forwarded
 * (minus `undefined` values, which read as absent) precisely so an undeclared
 * key reaches that screen instead of being silently dropped — a dropped key is
 * how a secret ends up believed-rejected and actually ignored.
 *
 * No defaults are invented for provider settings. Absent means absent: the
 * Resource Definition decides what an unset `framework` or `access` means, not
 * this catalog. Pure and deterministic — no clock, no randomness, no ambient
 * environment reads.
