/**
 * The Vercel provider's capability surface.
 *
 * Four equivalence classes — compute, object store, database, KV — each mapped
 * to a headline Vercel product. The surface is small, and every method on it
 * feeds a decision made elsewhere: `satisfies` feeds placement, `estimateCost`
 * feeds ranking, `realize` feeds the driver, `client` feeds whatever binds to
 * the deployed thing. The failure mode they share is that a wrong answer here
 * does not fail — it produces a plausible plan that is wrong.
