/**
 * Virtual worktrees, built on whatever this machine can actually do.
 *
 * A workspace is a directory an agent can work in without disturbing the
 * source. How it is produced depends on the tier (see capability.ts):
 *
 * - reflink / hardlink / copy → a real directory on disk, ready to `cd` into.
 * - overlayfs → layers on disk plus a merged path that only exists inside a
 *   mount namespace, so the caller runs commands through `exec`.
 *
 * Regenerable artifacts (node_modules, target, dist, .venv, caches) are
 * excluded by default, matching rift: they are the bulk of the bytes and the
 * cheapest thing to rebuild. `--copy-all` keeps them.
