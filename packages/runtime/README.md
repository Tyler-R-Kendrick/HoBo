# @hobo/runtime

The **SDK runtime-primitives package**: app-facing authoring surfaces and the
deterministic-replay library that backs them.

- **Trainable methods (ADR-0025 / ADR-0125)** — `training(fn, opts)`,
  signature-only `training.define()` empty implementations served by a
  contract-derived stub, the optional `@trainable` class-method decorator,
  the `"use training"` grounding lint, and `applyTrainingArtifact()` for
  apply-at-load promotion. See `src/training/`.
- **Deterministic replay** (`./replay` export) — the replay/divergence/
  equivalence engine (ADR-0086), promoted from the
  `deterministic-replay-engine` draft proof (frozen in
  `scripts/promotions.json`).

## Naming: `runtime` vs `runtimes/`

These are different concerns that share a word:

- **`packages/runtime` (`@hobo/runtime`, this package)** — the *SDK
  primitives* layer app code imports (`import { training } from
  "@hobo/runtime"`); no I/O, no substrate.
- **`packages/runtimes/*` (e.g. `@hobo/runtime-local`)** — concrete *runtime
  backends* implementing the durable runtime ports (EventStore, Queue,
  Clock, component host) for a substrate. `runtime-local/src/replay.ts` is
  that backend's record/replay **link mode** (ADR-0076), not this package's
  replay engine.

The glossary's "Runtime" entry records the same disambiguation.
