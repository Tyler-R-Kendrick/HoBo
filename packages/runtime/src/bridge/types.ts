// The Bridge: session-scoped boundary routing for local/remote dev
// (plan 0008; generalizes Bridge-to-Kubernetes beyond Kubernetes). Every
// service boundary is a WIT port whose peers are PACT-emulable, so a
// boundary can be re-pointed per DEV SESSION — your calls take the bridge
// to the process on your laptop, everyone else's stay live — on any
// provider, because the routing happens at the boundary, not in the
// orchestrator. The modes are the ADR-0076 set (live · mock · fork/bridge
// · shadow · record/replay · fault); recording is always on, so every
// bridged session doubles as specification-by-example capture.
