 * nothing. `params` and `contract.input`, maps by name, are copied entry by
 * entry, so their keys may not be symbols; a declared shape is copied whole as
 * JSON, so it may hold no field that is not JSON and no symbol key at any
 * depth. Each of these is read as `GroundingOptions` types it, not as the
 * interface grounding names for it today. So a ts-autocode bump stops this
 * compiling when it renames a field, adds one (keyed by a name or a symbol, to
 * the options, the contract, the output or a field description, directly or
 * by typing the place as a subtype or a union with one), makes `methodRef` or
 * `intent` optional, retypes one, keys `params` or `contract.input` by symbols
 * too, or gives a declared shape a field that is not JSON or an object with a
 * symbol key at any depth (scripts/test/ts-autocode-grounding-drift.test.ts).
 * A cast here would let that drift through, and `training()` would then
 * register the method under its function name, with no intent, or without the
 * added field. What the check reads is the types: a property grounding sets
 * on a value without declaring it in its type is not seen. A shape whose type
 * alias refers to itself is read once, but a shape field typed by an
 * interface (as one where upstream's `ShapeDescriptor` refers to itself would
 * be) and a `readonly` array field fail to compile, since `JsonObject` takes
 * neither (an interface has no index signature, and `JsonValue`'s arrays are
 * mutable), so a bump that brings one fails closed; a field description typed
 * as a union with a member that has no `example` compiles, and that member is
 * copied with none; and an array is read only through its elements, so a
 * symbol key on the array type itself
 * (`tags?: string[] & { [GROUNDED]: string }`) compiles, unseen.
