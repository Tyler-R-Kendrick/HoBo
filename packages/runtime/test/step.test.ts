/**
 * Step definition and the retry budget the engine applies around a step body.
 *
 * A step is the *side-effecting* unit of a durable workflow: its result is
 * journaled so replay short-circuits it after a restart. That makes the retry
 * rules load-bearing rather than ergonomic — a step retried once too often is a
 * charge taken twice, and a step not retried at all is a workflow that fails on
 * a blip a caller told it to tolerate.
 *
 * Three rules, in the order they are checked:
 *
 * **Fatal beats everything.** A `FatalError` stops at the first attempt no
 * matter what the budget says, because the body has declared that retrying
 * cannot help.
 *
 * **`RetryableError` overrides the budget rather than adding to it.** The body
 * knows more about the failure than the author of the options block did, so
 * when it names a number that number wins — upward *or* downward.
 *
 * **The budget counts retries, not attempts.** `retries: 0` means one attempt.
 * An off-by-one here is the difference between a step that never retries and
 * one that runs twice.
 *
 * Every failure surfaces as a `WorkflowFailure` naming the step, since that is
 * what the engine journals as `run.StepFailed` and what an operator reads.
