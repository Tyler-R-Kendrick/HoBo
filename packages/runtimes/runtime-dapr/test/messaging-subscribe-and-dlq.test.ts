/**
 * Subscribing over daprd: what happens when a handler throws.
 *
 * `subscribe` is the loop an application actually runs — consume a batch, hand
 * each message to a handler, and decide what to do when the handler fails. The
 * decision is where all the risk is, because both wrong answers are bad in
 * ways that take a while to notice.
 *
 * **Retry forever and one poison message stops the queue.** Every consumer
 * behind it starves while the same message is redelivered, and the topic looks
 * healthy from the outside — messages are flowing in, nothing is erroring
 * loudly, and throughput is zero.
 *
 * **Drop on first failure and a transient blip loses data silently.** A
 * downstream timeout is the commonest handler failure and the one most likely
 * to succeed on the next attempt.
 *
 * So a failure nacks — putting the message back for another attempt — until
 * the delivery count reaches the subscription's `maxDeliveryAttempts`, and
 * then the message is dead-lettered: acked under the real consumer group so it
 * stops being redelivered, and recorded on the event log so it can be found.
 *
 * The ack on the dead-letter path is deliberate and worth stating: it acks
 * rather than nacking first, because a nack would return the message to the
 * queue one more time after the platform has already decided it is poison.
 *
 * Two smaller properties come with it:
 *
 * **A failed handler does not stop the batch.** The remaining messages are
 * still delivered — one bad message must not cost the whole batch.
 *
 * **Ack and nack refuse a message that is not in flight.** Acking something
 * the consumer does not hold means either a double-ack or a forged id, and
 * both would release a lease someone else owns.
