/**
 * The OCI Camp host — ensure, schedule, and roll back.
 *
 * This adapter packs WASM components as OCI images and schedules them on
 * Kubernetes through the kubectl PACT boundary. Three properties matter more
 * than the mechanics.
 *
 * **`ensure` and `servePrivate` have different cluster requirements.** Ensure
 * only needs a usable kubectl client — it is what a `hobo yard ensure` runs on
 * a laptop with no cluster, and failing it there would make the install
 * command unusable offline. `servePrivate` genuinely needs a reachable
 * cluster, so it refuses up front rather than failing partway through a
 * schedule.
 *
 * **A failed schedule rolls back everything it already did.** Half a
 * deployment is worse than none: the components that did come up would serve
 * an app whose other half is missing, and nothing else would tear them down.
 * Every port-forward is closed and every scheduled workload deleted before the
 * error propagates.
 *
 * **A component with no built wasm is refused by name.** The OCI host does not
 * build — `@hobo/runtime-wasm` does — and scheduling a component with no
 * artifact would deploy the runtime image with nothing to run inside it, which
 * comes up healthy and serves nothing.
 *
 * Kubernetes names are sanitized rather than passed through: a resource named
 * `My Service!` is a valid Bindle name and an invalid Kubernetes one, and the
 * apply would be rejected by the apiserver with a message about DNS labels.
