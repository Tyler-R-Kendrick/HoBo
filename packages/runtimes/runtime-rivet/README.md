# `@hobo/runtime-rivet`

Optional **Camp runtime** realizing HoBo `actor()` / `agent()` grains on a
HoBo-owned **actor-local journal**. Rivet is a resolver, not a topology noun
and not an authoring model.

| HoBo contract | Realization |
|---|---|
| `ActorHost` / `defineActor` | Rivet placement + compound key |
| Event facts | `hobo_events` + stream-head CAS in actor SQLite |
| Durable mailbox | action-first `hobo_inbox` (not raw Rivet queue) |
| Effects | `hobo_outbox` staged with facts; dispatch after commit |

**ADR-0031 stands:** in-process wasm / native local remains the fallback.
Rivet is the *preferred compatible* resolver when Matching evidence is current.

Published `rivetkit` 2.3.10 `.cjs` uses `import.meta`, so `require("rivetkit")`
throws. Adapters and CJS hosts must `await import("rivetkit")` via
`loadRivetkit()`. Live tests fail closed: missing package, CJS load error,
engine start failure, or a non-`pong` action is a test failure — never a skip.

## Fidelity

- Default `local-sqlite`: `node:sqlite` behind the same journal schema Rivet `c.db` will host.
- `rivetkit` is advertised only after a pinned package + conformance digest exist.
- Raw Rivet queue **receive-loss** is not HoBo at-least-once. Inbox rows are authority.

```ts
import { createRivetRuntimeHost } from "@hobo/runtime-rivet";

const bundle = createRivetRuntimeHost({ tenantId: "acme", campId: "prod" });
const accepted = bundle.actors.accept({
  identity: {
    tenantId: "acme",
    projectId: "shop",
    actorTypeId: "Cart",
    keySegments: ["user-1"],
    schemaVersion: 1,
  },
  commandId: "cmd-1",
  commandType: "addItem",
  payload: { sku: "hat" },
  expectedRevision: 0,
});
```

## Non-guarantees

No cross-actor transaction, no global actor SQL, no exactly-once external
effects, no namespace-as-sandbox, no `wait: true` between actors, no Celld
resolver in this package.
