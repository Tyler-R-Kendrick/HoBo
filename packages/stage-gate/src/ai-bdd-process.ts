/**
 * One ai-bdd command as a process (ADR-0172), bounded in time and in what it
 * passes on:
 *
 * - It runs in a process group of its own (POSIX). A timeout, or SIGINT or
 *   SIGTERM to the gate, stops that group: the signal first (SIGTERM for a
 *   timeout, else the one the gate got), and SIGKILL to whatever of it is left
 *   after AI_BDD_GRACE_MS. Its own exit stops what it left in its group the
 *   same way. Playwright launches each browser as the leader of a group of its
 *   own, out of reach of a group signal, and closes it from its SIGTERM and
 *   SIGINT handlers: that is why the signal goes first. A process ai-bdd
 *   started in another group and that ignores SIGTERM can outlive the check.
 *   On Linux a group that holds only zombies of one thread counts as gone
 *   (src/process-group.ts): under a PID 1 or subreaper that never reaps, one
 *   would hold every stop for the whole grace. Where /proc cannot show that
 *   (a process whose main thread exited while others run, a /proc of another
 *   PID namespace, none readable), the group counts as live until SIGKILL.
 *   Once ai-bdd has exited and its group is gone, its output is waited for
 *   DRAIN_MS more at most: a process outside the group that holds the pipe
 *   open does not hold the check.
 * - Its output is relayed, but only the first RELAY_BYTES as they come and
 *   the last RELAY_BYTES when it exits: the stage-gate runner captures a
 *   check's stderr up to CHECK_OUTPUT_LIMIT, and a check that writes more is
 *   killed for it, so a passing run that prints a lot must not reach that
 *   limit. Nothing is buffered whole; the evidence keeps the last TAIL_CHARS
 *   characters.
