 * Stopping ai-bdd's process group (ADR-0172, src/ai-bdd-process.ts): a signal
 * to all of it, SIGKILL to what is left after the grace period, and a typed
 * answer of how the stop ended: gone, killed, or unconfirmed with a reason.
 * kill answering ESRCH means the kernel found no member; EPERM or EACCES
 * means it found members this process may not signal (another user's, or a
 * security module said no), which no later signal can help with.
 *
 * Between the two, each poll asks the kernel first, with kill(-pgid, 0), and
 * reads the Linux process table only while the kernel still finds a member: a
 * group that is gone costs no scan. kill(-pgid, 0) finds a zombie as readily
 * as a live process, and a PID 1 or subreaper that never reaps would otherwise
 * hold every stop for the whole grace period: a group the table shows holding
 * only zombies is SIGKILLed at once.
