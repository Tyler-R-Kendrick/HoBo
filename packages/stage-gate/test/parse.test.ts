/**
 * Parsing and re-serialising a stage-gate record.
 *
 * A stage-gate record is the artifact that says a build passed its gate. It is
 * written by CI, read by whatever decides whether something may ship, and
 * therefore is exactly the kind of document somebody would be tempted to hand-
 * edit. The parser is the only thing standing between an edited file and a
 * release.
 *
 * That makes one group of tests more important than all the others: the
 * **passed-record constraints**. A record claiming `status: "passed"` has to
 * survive checks the other statuses do not — every check passed, a verified
 * signature, a real artifact digest, and the right gate id. A parser that let a
 * `passed` record through with a failed check inside it would launder a red
 * build into a green attestation, and every downstream reader would believe it.
 * Each of those four constraints gets its own test, so weakening one is a
 * failure rather than a silently wider door.
 *
 * The rest of the parser has a subtler property worth pinning: it **accumulates**
 * issues rather than throwing on the first. A CI author fixing a hand-written
 * record one error per run is the experience that design avoids, so the tests
 * check that several problems are reported together.
 *
 * Both naming conventions are accepted throughout — snake_case as written by
 * CI, camelCase as produced by TypeScript callers. Where a field is read, both
 * spellings are tested, because supporting one silently is how half a document
 * ends up ignored.
