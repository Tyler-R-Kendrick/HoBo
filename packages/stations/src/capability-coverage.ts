/**
 * Station capability coverage: what the Station's Yards *can allocate*,
 * aggregated into one auditable report, plus the gaps where nothing can.
 *
 * `capabilities.ts` answers "what facilities does the host under this Station
 * offer its occupants" (runtime, vcs, pam, replay …) by matching declarations
 * against host observations. This module answers the sibling question one
 * layer out: "which ADR-0151 capability profiles can this Station satisfy at
 * all, through which Yards, on which providers, and which expected profiles
 * can it not satisfy". Same fail-closed posture, same deep-frozen derived
 * record, different evidence source.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and easy to lose:
 *
 * 1. **A Yard is a catalog, not an inventory** (ADR-0157 decision 1). A row
 *    says the Yard is *able to* allocate an offering for a profile. It is not
 *    a selection, a pool, or a record of anything running. Several rows per
 *    profile is therefore the normal case, not a conflict: Azure's `web` is
 *    legitimately Static Web Apps *and* App Service *and* Container Apps *and*
 *    AKS. Aggregation reports **coverage breadth** — how many distinct
 *    offerings, in which Yards, on which providers.
 *
 * 2. **This never ranks and never picks a winner.** Ordering here is a
 *    canonical lexicographic sort on identifiers so two equal inputs produce
 *    one output; it carries no preference. Selection is ADR-0151's job at
 *    resolution time — hard gates then lexicographic ordering. An aggregation
 *    that chose an offering would be a second, unversioned selection point,
 *    which ADR-0151 decision 11 and ADR-0157 decision 4 both forbid.
 *
 * 3. **Nothing is silently dropped.** A malformed catalog, a bad profile id,
 *    or a row constraining neither offering is a typed refusal, never a
 *    skipped row — a dropped row would understate coverage, and understated
 *    coverage is a portability lie in the same family as an overstated one.
 *
 * Determinism: the report is a pure function of its input and carries **no
 * timestamp**. Nothing about coverage depends on when it was computed (same
 * reasoning as the localhost Yard seed record), and a `generatedAt` would make
 * two equal inputs compare unequal — comparability is the whole value of this
 * record. No clock, no randomness, no ambient environment is read.
