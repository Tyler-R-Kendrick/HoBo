# @hobo/trails — Architecture Evidence

HoBo Trails: versioned, app-owned, composable continuous migration runbooks.
Continuous identity remains hands-off (zero Bindle config) and is composed as
the platform recipe `identity.continuous`.

## Schema and constraints

- Protobuf records live in [`data-models/trails.proto`](./data-models/trails.proto).
- CUE constraints in [`data-models/trails.cue`](./data-models/trails.cue) bound
  every protobuf message.
- PACT consumer evidence (observe boundary) under [`contracts/`](./contracts).

## Parse, don't validate

`defineTrail` is the single parse, don't validate boundary for Trail definitions:
untrusted authoring input becomes frozen `TrailDefinition` / `TrailStep` **derived
types** with ordered dependency validation and secret-free checks before the
runner accepts a plan. Callers receive derived domain types — never re-check raw
JSON maps.

## Event architecture

- **Command** — plan / run / abort / compensate / baseline / repair.
- **Events** — `trail.Started|Planned|DualActive|Progressed|Validated|Cutover|Compensated|Aborted|Failed|HistoryRecorded`.
- **Actor** — TrailRunService is the single-writer aggregate for a trail run.
- **Event store** — append-only run events (identity-linked use never-compact retention).
- **Materialized view / projection** — TrailHistoryStore folds HistoryRecorded.
- **Snapshot** — TrailRunRecord for observe surfaces.
- **Read store** — history list + can-trail dry-run evidence.

## Hands-off continuous identity

Architecture guarantee: pure continuous identity Trails expand from
`identity.continuous` with `bindleConfigRequired: false`. Matching/policy
activation via `activateIdentityContinuousFromMatching` requires no Trail
authoring. Guards and Golden oracles assert this property.

## Public surface encapsulation

`@hobo/identity` (control plane, dual fixtures, FeatureFlagStore / Harness) is an
**internal** dependency only. Package entry and all published `.d.ts` files must
not import or re-export foreign packages. Consumers receive Trails-owned DTOs
(`IdentityTrailHandle`, `TrailIdentityProgress`, `TrailCanMigrateEvidence`,
`ProgressiveFlagPort` internals). Encapsulation is gated by
`test/public-surface.test.ts`.
