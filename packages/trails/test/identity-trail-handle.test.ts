/**
 * The hands-off identity trail handle.
 *
 * The architectural claim this file guards is that a pure identity-continuous
 * migration needs no Trail authoring and no Bindle config — Matching activates
 * it. A regression there is not a crash: it is a migration that starts
 * requiring a config file nobody wrote, and the failure lands on whoever tries
 * to run it rather than on whoever broke it. `assertIdentityContinuousHandsOff`
 * exists to fail loudly instead, and every branch of it is checked here.
