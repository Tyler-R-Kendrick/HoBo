/**
 * Builder authoring for Station, Yard and Camp — one verb per noun, matching
 * the shape `bindle(name, (b) => …)` already has.
 *
 * The problem this solves is not typing effort, it is that the old surface made
 * you learn four unrelated shapes to say one thing: an options object for a
 * Yard, a second options object for a Station, a free `camp()` call, and then
 * `attachCampToYard(c, { yardId, providerId })` — where the author had to hand
 * the Yard back its own two identifiers. Nesting is what removes that: a Camp
 * declared inside `y.camp(…)` cannot disagree with its Yard because it is never
 * told anything the Yard does not already know.
 *
 * The provider is an *argument*, not a builder call. `yard(azure, "prod-eu", …)`
 * establishes it before the callback runs, so there is no window in which slot
 * calls are written against a Yard that has no provider yet, and no way for
 * moving a line to change whether the code makes sense. Values authors would
 * otherwise spell as bare strings — capability profiles and Camp environment
 * types — come from the typed vocabulary in `@hobo/core` (`capability`,
 * `ENV_TYPES`) so a typo is a compile error rather than a row that matches
 * nothing.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **It is a front end, not a second parser.** Every builder terminates in
 *    `defineYard` / `defineStation` / `camp()` — the code that already ships.
 *    `SLOT_KEY_MISMATCH`, `SLOT_PROFILE_MISMATCH`, `YARD_BINDING_DUPLICATE`,
 *    `YARD_BINDING_EMPTY_CONSTRAINT`, `SLOT_BINDING_CREDENTIAL_PROPERTY`,
 *    `STATION_NO_YARDS`, `STATION_DUPLICATE_YARD`,
 *    `camp-provider-selection-forbidden` and `camp-bindle-ownership-forbidden`
 *    all still fire, with their existing codes and existing messages. A second
 *    validation path that drifts from the first would be strictly worse than
 *    the verbose syntax it replaced.
 * 2. **Call order is not information.** Slots are emitted in the fixed
 *    `CAPABILITY_SLOTS` order rather than the order the author called them, and
 *    nested Camps are sorted by id before they reach `yard()` (registration is
 *    a set, exactly as `defineStation` already treats its Yards). Two builders
 *    that declare the same things in different orders are deep-equal.
 * 3. **Slots accumulate.** `y.web(a)` followed by `y.web(b)` declares two web
 *    offerings, never one: a Yard row set says what the provider is *able to*
 *    allocate, so silently dropping the first offering would be a portability
 *    lie rather than a last-write-wins convenience.
 *
 * Scope, honestly: the Yard builder has exactly `defineYard`'s expressive
 * range. `require` / `prefer` / `isolation` / `network` / `properties` /
 * `runtimeId` / `resolverDefaults` are Yard fields that `defineYard` does not
 * accept either; authoring those still goes through `yard()` directly. Widening
 * the builder past its compile target would mean bypassing it, which is the one
 * thing this module must not do.
 *
 * These are exported from `@hobo/yards` under `buildStation` / `buildYard` /
 * `buildCamp` because `yard` and `camp` are already taken here by the parse
 * boundaries the builder compiles into. `@hobo/cloud-providers` re-exports them
 * as `station` / `yard` / `camp`, which is the one-import authoring surface.
