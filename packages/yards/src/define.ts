/**
 * Slot-keyed Yard authoring — the ergonomic surface that **compiles down to**
 * the binding rows `yard()` already parses (ADR-0157).
 *
 * Today an operator authors a Yard by typing raw rows:
 * `{ profile: "data.postgres/v1", productId: "aws.rds-postgres/v1", … }`.
 * Those rows are the planner's IR. They are the right thing to *store* and the
 * wrong thing to *type*: a magic string carries no autocomplete, no slot
 * vocabulary, and no check that the row you wrote belongs where you put it.
 *
 * This module makes the rows a compile target. Three properties are
 * load-bearing and easy to lose:
 *
 * 1. **It compiles, it does not parse.** Every authored value still crosses the
 *    existing `yard()` / `parseYardBindings()` boundary — canonicalization,
 *    credential screening, duplicate refusal, pin-conflict refusal and deep
 *    freezing all happen exactly once, in the code that already ships. A second
 *    parser here would be a second opinion about what a credential is.
 * 2. **Slot and profile must agree.** A `bucket` slot holding
 *    `data.postgres/v1` is a defect, not a preference: the slot vocabulary is
 *    the capability the app asked for, and a row filed under the wrong one
 *    would silently constrain a capability nobody named. It is refused with
 *    `SLOT_PROFILE_MISMATCH`.
 * 3. **Authoring order is not information.** Slots are compiled in the fixed
 *    `CAPABILITY_SLOTS` order, never in object-key order, so two authors who
 *    type the same slots in different orders get deep-equal Yards. (Rows are a
 *    set — ADR-0151 forbids authoring order reaching selection.)
 *
 * `defineStation` lives here for the same reason and with one sharp caveat: a
 * Station is control-plane **occupancy** and is never a parent of a Yard
 * (ADR-0131 fixes `Bindle ⊂ Camp ⊂ Yard ⊂ Junction` as the containment axis,
 * and Station is not on it). So `defineStation` emits a **registration**
 * manifest — "the Yards this Station's conductor brokers" — and deliberately
 * does not import `@hobo/stations`: the composition root hands the manifest to
 * `station()`, keeping Stations free of any Yard coupling.
