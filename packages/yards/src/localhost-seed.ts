/**
 * The localhost Yard seed (ADR-0157): the built-in `yard:local` whose binding
 * rows say which local implementation stands in for each Bindle catalog
 * primitive on a developer machine.
 *
 * The function is **pure**. It takes observations — what a Station reported
 * about this host — and returns a record. It never reads the filesystem, never
 * looks at the clock, and never randomizes, so the same observations always
 * produce a deep-equal seed including ordering. Discovery is somebody else's
 * job; this module only decides what a given set of observations entitles the
 * local Yard to claim.
 *
 * Two honesty rules are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Nothing is silently omitted.** A primitive whose local implementation is
 *   unavailable (its enabling capability was not observed) or does not exist at
 *   all appears in `unavailable` with a reason naming what to do about it. A
 *   dropped primitive would read as "HoBo has no opinion here" when the truth
 *   is "HoBo cannot do this locally".
 * - **Every row carries its fidelity** (ADR-0042). An in-memory queue is
 *   `simulated`, not `real`, and the label rides into the Yard's binding
 *   properties so a downstream report can split coverage by fidelity instead of
 *   showing a bare green tick.
