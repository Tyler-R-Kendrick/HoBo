/**
 * Publish `site/` to the `gh-pages` branch.
 *
 * GitHub Pages for this repo serves the **`gh-pages` branch at `/`** (legacy
 * build type, https://tyler-r-kendrick.github.io/HoBo/). There was no script
 * for it: the previous deploy was made by hand, which is why the live site sat
 * on a stale commit long after `main` moved — nothing recorded how to redo it,
 * so nobody did.
 *
 * The branch is published as a **single orphan commit** holding the built
 * output, matching what is already there. History on `gh-pages` is worthless —
 * it is generated output, recoverable by rebuilding the source commit it names
 * — and keeping it would grow the clone for every deploy.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm run site:deploy              # build, then publish
 *   pnpm run site:deploy -- --dry-run # build and show what would publish
