/**
 * `pretest` shim: guarantee a package's build output exists before its tests
 * run, without paying for it twice.
 *
 * Package `pretest` hooks used to be `pnpm run build` (and, for 19 packages, a
 * chain of `pnpm --filter <dep> build` calls). Those run *outside* turbo, so
 * they never hit the cache: a full sweep paid ~150 cold `tsc` invocations,
 * every one of them redundant with the `build` task turbo had already run and
 * cached.
 *
 * Turbo sets `TURBO_HASH` in every task process (verified under
 * `envMode: "strict"`), and `tasks.test.dependsOn` includes `build`, so inside
 * turbo the guarantee already holds and this exits immediately. Outside turbo
 * — `pnpm --filter <pkg> test`, the stage-gate workflow steps — it delegates to
 * turbo so the build is *cached* rather than re-run.
