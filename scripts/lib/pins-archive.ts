/**
 * One member out of a release archive (a gzip-compressed ustar file).
 *
 * What a pin of an archive trusts is the archive's sha256; the executable is
 * the one member the pin names. The archive is read once: every compressed
 * byte is hashed as it streams, and the member it yields is kept only if those
 * bytes hash to the pin. So the bytes used are the bytes verified, not a file
 * that was verified earlier under the same name.
 *
 * Nothing else in the archive is written anywhere, and no name in the archive
 * ever becomes a path: the member's bytes go to the cache path the pin's
 * `entry` names. A name such as `../../.bashrc` or `/etc/passwd` is refused
 * outright. What the reader accepts and refuses, and why, is `pins-tar.ts`;
 * here:
 *
 * - the whole gzip stream is inflated and checked, every member's CRC and
 *   length included, as `gzip -d` checks it under `tar -xzf`: a bad CRC, a
 *   missing trailer, or any byte after the last gzip member (trailing zeros,
 *   which gzip ignores, among them) is ARCHIVE_MALFORMED, however far past
 *   the tar end blocks it is;
 * - the data inflated only to be skipped (other entries' data and padding,
 *   and whatever follows the end blocks) may be at most `INFLATE_RATIO`
 *   times the archive's size plus `INFLATE_SLACK`; past that the archive is
 *   ARCHIVE_UNSUPPORTED, so a small archive cannot make the reader inflate
 *   gigabytes it then throws away. Headers are bounded apart, by the entry
 *   count (`pins-tar.ts`), and the member by its size cap;
 * - a file that cannot be read (absent, a directory, unreadable) is
 *   ARCHIVE_UNREADABLE;
 * - the extracted file is written to a private partial file, made 0755
 *   through its own descriptor and renamed into place only when the archive's
 *   digest matched. The mode is always 0755, whatever the member's header
 *   says: setuid, setgid and sticky bits are dropped, and a 0644 member is
 *   made executable. What the reader is held to against `tar` is the name and
 *   the bytes, not the mode;
 * - on any failure the partial file is removed, and the message ends with
 *   "nothing was kept", or with where the partial file was kept when it
 *   could not be removed;
 * - a failure to create, write, sync or rename that file (no space, an I/O
 *   error, no permission, a write that makes no progress) is
 *   ARCHIVE_WRITE_FAILED, naming the errno and keeping the error as its
 *   `cause`: it says nothing about the archive, so it is never reported as
 *   ARCHIVE_MALFORMED.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript with node builtins only.
