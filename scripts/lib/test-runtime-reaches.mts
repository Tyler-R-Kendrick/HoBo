/**
 * Reaches into another workspace package that a file makes at run time, by a
 * path it assembles rather than an import the reader can follow, and the
 * registry that declares what each one needs.
 *
 * A path the file assembles (lib/test-import-specifiers `ModuleFacts.paths`)
 * names package P where, from its start, a computed part (`*`), `..` or
 * `node_modules`, it continues with P's directory, P's package name, or a run
 * of P's directory's trailing segments: `packages/runtimes/runtime-local` is
 * named by `../../runtimes/runtime-local` and `*`/`runtime-local` alike. In an
 * absolute path (`/…`, `C:\…`, `file:…`), whose root is unknown, P's whole
 * directory names it wherever it is. A path that starts `./` or `../` is also
 * read from the file's directory, as `new URL(…, import.meta.url)` resolves
 * it: from `packages/cli/test/`, `../../core` is `packages/core`. The file
 * reaches P at run time when the path:
 * - goes on into P's build output directory, the first segment of the
 *   `outDir` its build compiles with, else `dist/` (`join(dir, "packages",
 *   "hobo", "dist", "bin", "hobo.js")`, `"../../bindles/dist/index.js"`); or
 * - ends at P's directory or name, or goes on into a computed segment
 *   (`join(hoboDir, file)`), in a file that runs or loads something by a
 *   computed path (`ModuleFacts.loadsComputed`): `join(root, "packages",
 *   "adapters", "adapter-hono")` linked into a generated app, or
 *   `new URL("../../hobo", import.meta.url)` linked into a temporary root. It
 *   ends at P where it names P's directory in more than one segment
 *   (`packages/hobo`, `runtimes/runtime-local`) or right after `..`, or names
 *   P by its name after `node_modules` (or a scoped name after any anchor).
 *   One segment after a computed root (`join(evidence, "events")`) is a name,
 *   not a path to P; so is a package name at a string's start
 *   (`"@hobo/bindles"`, `` `@hobo/app-${name}` ``), unless it goes on into
 *   its build output directory.
 *
 * A path that names a package by a computed segment reaches a package the
 * check cannot name, and counts the same way: a directory that holds workspace
 * packages (`packages`, `packages/runtimes`, or `runtimes` after an anchor) or
 * a scope they are under (`@hobo`), then a computed segment, then any
 * workspace package's build output directory, the end, or another computed
 * segment (`join(root, "packages", name, "dist")`,
 * `` `node_modules/@hobo/${name}` ``, `` new URL(`../../${name}`, …) ``).
 * `join(root, "packages", name, "package.json")` reads a tracked file and does
 * not count.
 *
 * A path that goes on into anything else of P's (its source, `bin/`,
 * `package.json`, its `node_modules`) needs no build of P and is not a reach;
 * nor is one that names P only in the middle of another directory
 * (`…/s0-04-protobuf-cue-codegen/packages/schema-tools`), nor a glob's
 * literal `*`.
 *
 * What this cannot see, so passes: a path assembled across files or behind a
 * name (`join(packagesDir, "hobo")` with `packagesDir` bound elsewhere is one
 * segment after a computed root; a helper that returns a sibling's directory
 * to a test that spawns from it, where the helper itself loads nothing); a
 * path with no literal anchor (`join(here, "..", "..", name)`, a path from
 * the environment); one built another way (`segs.join("/")`, `+=`,
 * `path.format`); a loader reached only through another module; and what a
 * child process loads. A tracked file handed to a child (`bin/hobo.mjs`, a
 * sibling's `src/run.ts` under tsx) is tracked source, so it needs no build
 * here, and its own imports are not read.
 *
 * A reach whose path is rooted at a temporary directory the file visibly makes
 * (lib/test-import-specifiers `TEMPORARY`: `mkdtempSync(…)`, `tmpdir()`, a
 * `/tmp/` literal, or a name bound only to one) is a stub tree: it still needs
 * an entry, since the reader may misjudge a root, but never a build. A file
 * whose only reaches are stubs is declared `{ "from", "stubOnly": true,
 * "reason" }`, which holds only while the reader sees no other reach from it.
 *
 * The check cannot see what such a reach loads, so an undeclared one fails.
 * A declaration in `scripts/test-deps-runtime-reaches.json` says what the file
 * needs built, `{ "from": "<file>", "needs": ["<package>#build"], "why": "…" }`,
 * and the check holds every test task that loads the file to those builds.
