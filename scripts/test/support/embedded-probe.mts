/**
 * Child of pins-probe-signal.test.ts: a program that embeds `remoteHas` and
 * has a SIGINT handler of its own. It asks a server whose fetch never ends
 * (a held git on PATH), signals itself once that fetch has begun, and reports
 * how the question ended, how often its own handler ran, what is left in the
 * cache, and whether a SIGKILL was sent to a process group after the git
 * had ended (it waits past the 2 s escalation to see).
 *
 * argv: <repository url> <commit> ; env: PROBE_MARK, XDG_CACHE_HOME, PATH
