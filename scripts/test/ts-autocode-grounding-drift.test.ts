/**
 * Grounding drift gate for the ts-autocode submodule (ADR-0128, ADR-0169).
 *
 * `@hobo/runtime` registers what ts-autocode-grounding composes
 * (`GroundingOptions`) as its own `TrainingOptions`, and hands grounding the
 * decorator metadata it reads (packages/runtime/src/training/granular.ts). A
 * cast or a copy that lets an upstream change through registers a trainable
 * whose identity silently falls back to the function's own name, whose intent
 * is undefined, or without a field grounding added. This test compiles
 * granular.ts with the runtime package's own compiler options against the
 * pinned grounding source, as it is and then with each change below made in
 * memory. These must stop granular.ts compiling (DRIFTS): `methodRef` or
 * `intent` renamed or made optional; `contract.ref` or `params` retyped; a
 * field description's `example` removed; a field added, by name or by symbol,
 * to the options, the contract, the output or a field description; the
 * output's `returns`, or `params`' values, typed as a field description with
 * a field added; `params` or `contract.input` keyed by symbols too; a
 * declared shape given a field that is not JSON (on the shape descriptor, or
 * on `contract.input`'s values) or a symbol key (on the shape descriptor, on
 * `contract.input`'s values, on an object one field down, on one member of a
 * union, as the shape descriptor or as `contract.output`, or, required or
 * optional, on the shape a type-alias shape descriptor holds of itself); and
 * either metadata parameter retyped.
 * These must not (STILL_COMPILES), since they drop nothing: a shape field
 * holding an array of a type-alias shape, a type-alias shape descriptor that
 * holds itself in an array, or beside `null`, or through a second alias, a
 * JSON field added to `contract.input`'s values only, and the output's
 * `returns` or `params`' values typed as a union with a field description
 * that has no `example`. The test needs the submodule checked out
 * (`pnpm run pins:fetch ts-autocode`), not built.
