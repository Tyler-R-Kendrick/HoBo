// Supplied artwork. Anything dropped into public/parallax/plates/ becomes a
// layer of the trail band: the file is tiled along x and scrolled at the
// speed named here, at its own aspect ratio, so nothing is squashed.
//
// The slot name is the file name. `plates/clouds.png` fills the cloud layer,
// `plates/sky.png` the distant one, and so on. An empty slot renders nothing,
// so the band is whatever artwork is present plus the one thing it draws.
//
// A plate must repeat cleanly left-to-right; the band tiles it, it does not
// mirror or blend the join. The whole image height maps onto the band height,
// so a plate is composed on a full-height canvas with its content at the
// scene position it belongs at, rather than cropped to its own content.

/**
 * How a plate becomes its night self. The band is achromatic, so this is the
 * whole of theming — but it is per-slot, because one rule does not fit
 * everything the scene is made of:
 *
 * - `invert` — ink and paper swap. Right for line art that reads as drawing:
 *   the ground is black on white by day and white on black by night.
 * - `keep` — untouched. Right for anything whose colour is the subject
 *   rather than its ink. A cloud is white because clouds are white; invert it
 *   and it becomes a hole in the sky.
 * - `rim` — kept dark and given a light outline, the same treatment Bo gets.
 *   Right for solid silhouettes that should stay solid: a telephone pole is a
 *   creosote post at noon and at midnight, picked out against the dark.

 * parallax speed, because that is what depth *is* here — the slower a layer
