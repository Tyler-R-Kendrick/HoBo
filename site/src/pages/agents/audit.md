# Agent audit & replay

If an agent acted, the log can explain it. “The model said so” is not an audit trail.

## What is recorded

| Fact class | Examples |
|---|---|
| Dispatch | `crew.AgentDispatched` (operators) / session open |
| Tools | MCP invocations + results (redacted) |
| Tokens | Grants by **reference** |
| Policy | `policy.Decided`, obligations |
| Guardrails | `guardrail.Blocked` |
| Handoffs | A2H request/resolve |

## Replay questions

- What tools ran between T0 and T1?  
- Which policy version allowed the destroy proposal?  
- What was the fence/deployment correlation id?  

Use `hobo inspect`, event exports, and `hobo attest` for external GRC — not screenshots of secrets.
