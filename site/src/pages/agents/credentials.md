# Agent credentials

Agents are first-class principals. They receive **scoped, short-lived** credentials — never ambient org-admin by default.

## Issuance loop

1. Agent authenticates (SVIDs / OIDC device flows as applicable).  
2. Declares needed capabilities for the task.  
3. Policy allow / deny / require-approval.  
4. Broker issues time-boxed token/scopes.  
5. Audit refs only in the log.  

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Least privilege | Scope to tools + resources needed |
| Short TTL | Rotate; no long-lived agent PATs as default |
| No plaintext in context | schemaOnlyView / fixtures for secrets |
| Spend caps | Policy breakers on runaway tool use |
| MCP auth | Same policy plane as CLI |
