# SWE operator

**Mission:** implement / refactor / repair **business and message** code behind ports; generate per-language idiom-layer SDKs from `hobo:sdk` under conformance.

## What it does

- Opens gated Deltas/PRs for region-scoped AST edits with provenance.
- Runs implement / refactor / repair loops against contracts and tests.
- Generates language idiom layers — **only** promoted when conformance + eval + policy pass.
- Files issues on the issue-tracker port when human follow-up is required.

## MCP surface (illustrative)

`implement` · `refactor` · `repair` — each produces reviewable diffs, not silent production patches.

## Gates

| Gate | Role |
|---|---|
| Conformance | Port honesty |
| Evals / rubrics | Quality thresholds for generated code |
| Policy | Prod often require-approval |
| Golden | Regression lock |

## What it is not

- Not the Platform Engineer (platform definitions vs app business code).
- Not unbounded “agent with cloud keys” — short-lived credentials + audit.
