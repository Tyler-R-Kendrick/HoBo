# Connectors

The Conductor acts on the outside world through a **connector registry** (GitHub App, Pulumi, cloud accounts, delivery systems). Entries hold **capability metadata + credentialRef** — never long-lived secrets in the catalog.

## Rules

1. Register → sign/provenance/conformance when required  
2. Broker short-lived access via Station connections + identity  
3. Fail closed when the connector or policy engine is unavailable
