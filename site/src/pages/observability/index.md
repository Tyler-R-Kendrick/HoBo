# Observability

HoBo’s primary observability substrate is the **event log** plus rebuildable projections. Metrics and traces export — they do not replace the log as authority.

## In this section

| Page | Topic |
|---|---|
| [Agent audit & replay](/HoBo/observability/agent-audit/) | Tool calls, token grants, handoffs as facts |
| [Session Replay](/HoBo/reference/session-replay/) | Privacy-first DOM/session reconstruction |
| [Metering](/HoBo/reference/metering/) | Usage facts and showback projections |
| [Streamer](/HoBo/reference/streamer/) | High-volume frames outside the domain log |
| [Endpoint Monitor](/HoBo/operations/endpoint-monitor/) | Synthetics and SLO burn |

## Principles

1. “Why did the system do X?” → **replay**, not SSH folklore.  
2. Crew and agent actions are facts.  
3. Sandbox lanes are labeled so experiments do not pollute baseline views.
