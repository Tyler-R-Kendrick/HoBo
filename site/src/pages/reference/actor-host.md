# ActorHost & fencing

**ActorHost** is the Camp port that hands out **single-writer leases** for aggregates (and similar actors). Without it, optimistic concurrency alone cannot stop a zombie process from appending with a stale view of the world after a steal.

## AggregateLease

A lease (conceptual shape):

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| Aggregate / actor key | Who is leased |
| `holderId` | Process or worker identity |
| `fenceToken` | Monotonic **bigint** epoch for this key |
| Expiry | Optional lease deadline |

`createInMemoryActorHost` exists for tests; production Camps use durable hosts that persist epoch across restarts (`@hobo/data` durable actor host paths + journal).

## Append algorithm coupling

When an aggregate is fenced:

1. Acquire/renew lease → receive `fenceToken`.
2. `decide` pure business rules in memory.
3. `append` / `commit` with `expectedSeq` **and** `fenceToken`.
4. Store compares token to stream head `owner_epoch`:
   - equal → accept (and may bump epoch per engine rules)
   - lower → `STALE_FENCE`
   - missing on fenced stream → `MISSING_FENCE`

Legacy streams start with `owner_epoch = 0` (unfenced). First fenced append enters fenced mode permanently.

## Error policy

| Code | Meaning | Aggregate retry? |
|---|---|---|
| `AGGREGATE_CONFLICT` / OCC | Stale expectedSeq | Yes — reload & retry |
| `STALE_FENCE` | Lost lease | **No** as blind OCC retry |
| `AGGREGATE_INVARIANT` | Business reject | No |

## Rules

- Never coerce `fenceToken` through `Number` — full 64-bit.
- Lease steal must advance epoch so the previous holder fails closed.
- Passivate emits facts; do not rely on process memory for “I still own it.”
