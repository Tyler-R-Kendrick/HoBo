# E2E Test Matrix Scope And Acceptance

HOBO-438 defines the M0 scope and acceptance record for the E2E Test Matrix productization
project.

## What This Proves

- The E2E Test Matrix has an explicit user/business goal and five primary personas.
- Scope in, scope out, non-goals, and service/UX/security/support boundaries are machine-checkable.
- The scope record depends on Plan 07, Plan 10, ADR-0082, the HOBO-500 persona matrix, and the
  release-notes evidence handoff.
- Owning initiative dependencies are mapped without moving compatibility, performance/load,
  bootstrap, support, security verification, or release cutline implementation into this issue.
- M1 evidence requirements are listed with owner, proof mode, and what each item proves.
- Follow-up M1-M4 work remains gated until M0 acceptance is recorded.

## Boundary

This package validates the M0 E2E Test Matrix scope record. It does not build a browser test
runner, full E2E harness, live provider execution path, broad browser/device lab, production load
test, or release decision.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\e2e-test-matrix-scope-acceptance test
```
