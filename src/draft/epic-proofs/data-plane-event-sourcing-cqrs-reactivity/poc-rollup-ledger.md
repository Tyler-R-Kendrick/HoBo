## Cascade absorptions

Changes to referenced technical proofs that this rollup has taken in, and what
each one did or did not move.

| Referenced proof | Change | Effect on this rollup |
|---|---|---|
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/deterministic-replay-engine` | `architecture/replay_report.cue` was unparseable — every line of every definition body carried a leading `#`, which is a definition sigil in CUE and not a comment, so the file had never been read by any tool that claims to check it. Repaired, and the divergence guard was then replaced. | No disposition, evidence path, or Linear link moves. The `Replay/live equivalence spike` row's `promoting_via_hobo_601` disposition and its `assertReplayEqualsLive` promotion target are unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/graphql-facade-runtime-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | GraphQL materialization and read-consistency simulation unchanged. |

The guard change is the part that is not merely cosmetic. `#ReplayDivergence`
carried `if live_state_digest == replay_state_digest { _conflict: "divergence
requires differing digests" }`, which reads as a refusal and enforces nothing:
assigning a string to a hidden field nothing else defines can never conflict.
Measured on a reduced case with `cue v0.14.0` — a divergence record whose two
digests are byte-identical exits **0** under the old form and fails under the
new `_divergent: true & (live_state_digest != replay_state_digest)` with
`conflicting values false and true`; a record with genuinely differing digests
exits 0 under both. This is the same form the production counterpart at
`packages/runtime/data-models/replay/replay_report.cue` now carries.

What this does **not** change is any claim in the table above. The
`Snapshot/replay divergence` row's `simulated` disposition rests on the
simulation's full-replay recovery assertion, not on this schema; nothing in
`simulation/` or `reference-implementation.yaml` consumed the unenforced guard,
because nothing could — the file did not parse.

## Adversarial Scope Review

| Review area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Requirement proven | The accepted POCs jointly prove write-side CQRS, log-backed reads, reactive materializations, portable sink/search boundaries, and fail-closed data integrity behavior. |
| Unsafe details discarded | Live databases, hosted embedders, unbounded fan-out, raw writes to projected sinks, silent stale reads, snapshot-as-truth, poison-event rewrites, and erasure deletes are excluded. |
| Contract strategy | Every service boundary has a consumer-side Pact fixture and deterministic mock provider strategy. Provider verification is deferred until real services exist. |
| Simulation risk | The simulation demonstrates architecture shape and negative behavior; it does not claim production EventStore, sink, gateway, GraphQL, search, or governance services exist. |
| Active epic conflict | The reference implementation is isolated under the Data Plane epic slug and does not modify other epic reference paths or child PR branches. |
| Follow-up split | Provider-side Pact verification, real sink adapters, live replication, and production poison-event provider integration remain follow-up work outside this reference PR. |

| `src/draft/technical-proofs/projection-consistency-reactivity-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Projection consistency and replay evidence unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/projection-sink-change-feed-conformance-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Change-feed and materialization evidence unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/reactor-skeleton-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Reactor and event-reactivity evidence unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/reads-your-writes-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Read-your-writes consistency evidence unchanged. |
