## Requirement proven

The POC jointly proves FR-042 / Plan 23 live-fix gating:

1. Simulated SLO regression triggers the loop.
2. Low-risk staging fixes auto-canary with SLO-gated auto-rollback on failure.
3. Failing traces persist as permanent regression tests.
4. Production-classified fixes block until human approval.
5. Generation, validation, policy, and deployment steps land as replayable events.
