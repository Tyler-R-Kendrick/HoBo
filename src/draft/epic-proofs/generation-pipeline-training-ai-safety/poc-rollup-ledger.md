## Cascade absorptions

Changes to referenced experience proofs that this rollup has taken in.

| Referenced proof | Change | Effect on this rollup |
|---|---|---|
| `src/draft/exp-proofs/dx/data-flywheel-privacy-spike` | `data-models/proof.cue` | none |

| `src/draft/technical-proofs/built-in-opto-training-engine-contract` | anti-slop JSON boundary cleanup | Candidate parsing and region-scoped screening retain the same behavior; the existing training simulation and Pact inventory remain the evidence. |

All of these are the same edit, applied across 58 draft proofs at once. Each
ships a `data-models/proof.proto` declaring `message ProofIdentity { string
slug = 1; string layer = 2; }` beside a `proof.cue` that defined a bare
anonymous `slug`/`layer` record — a record with no name to tie it to the
message it is supposed to constrain, which is what `architecture:guard`
reports as `missing-cue-constraints`. The record is now the named definition
`#ProofIdentity`, embedded at top level so the file still reads as the same
concrete data.

One constraint changed with it: `slug: string` became `slug: string & !=""`.
The old form restated proto3's declared type and refused nothing, so a proof
identifying itself with the empty string validated. Measured with cue v0.14.0,
old against new: `slug: ""` goes 0 → 1 and nothing else moves — a well-formed
record stays 0, `slug: 7` stays 1, `layer: "ux"` stays 1.

No disposition, evidence path, Linear link, or acceptance claim in the table
above moves. No proof in this epic identifies itself with an empty slug, so
nothing that validated before stops validating.

## Cascade absorptions

| Referenced proof | Change | Effect on this rollup |
|---|---|---|
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/generation-safety-gate-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Safety-gate simulation and Pact evidence unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/generation-validation-stage-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Validation-stage simulation and replay evidence unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/human-approval-generation-gate-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Approval-required behavior and safety evidence unchanged. |

## Adversarial Scope Review

| Review area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Requirement proven | The POCs jointly prove a contract-first generation loop, a bounded training/eval promotion loop, and a gated live-fix propagation loop. |
| Unsafe details discarded | Prompt/material authority, live network access, unbounded repair, self-approval, raw sensitive trajectory payloads, and silent source mutation are excluded. |
| Contract strategy | Every boundary is represented by a consumer-side Pact fixture and mocked provider. Provider verification is deferred until real services exist. |
| Simulation risk | The simulation does not claim production readiness; it demonstrates architecture shape and fail-closed behavior with deterministic fixtures. |
| Active epic conflict | The reference implementation is isolated under the Generation epic slug and does not touch other epic reference paths. |
| Follow-up split | Provider-side Pact verification and live service adapters remain follow-up work outside this reference PR. |
