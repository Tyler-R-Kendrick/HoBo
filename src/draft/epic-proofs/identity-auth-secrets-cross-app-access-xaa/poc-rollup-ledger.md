## Cascade absorptions

Changes to referenced experience proofs that this rollup has taken in.

| Referenced proof | Change | Effect on this rollup |
|---|---|---|
| `src/draft/exp-proofs/dx/svid-cross-tenant-guard-contract` | `data-models/proof.cue` | none |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/hobo-auth-json-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Signed manifest and broker fixture behavior unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/hobo-jwt-svid-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Workload SVID trust and claim behavior unchanged. |
| `src/draft/technical-proofs/hobo-principal-ref-contract` | latest validated leaf hardening | Principal serialization and policy subject behavior unchanged. |

All of these are the same edit, applied across 58 draft proofs at once. Each
ships a `data-models/proof.proto` declaring `message ProofIdentity { string
slug = 1; string layer = 2; }` beside a `proof.cue` that defined a bare
anonymous `slug`/`layer` record — a record with no name to tie it to the
message it is supposed to constrain, which is what `architecture:guard`
reports as `missing-cue-constraints`. The record is now the named definition
`#ProofIdentity`, embedded at top level so the file still reads as the same
concrete data.

One constraint changed with it: `slug: string` became `slug: string & !=""`.
The old form restated proto3's declared type and refused nothing, so a proof
identifying itself with the empty string validated. Measured with cue v0.14.0,
old against new: `slug: ""` goes 0 → 1 and nothing else moves — a well-formed
record stays 0, `slug: 7` stays 1, `layer: "ux"` stays 1.

No disposition, evidence path, Linear link, or acceptance claim in the table
above moves. No proof in this epic identifies itself with an empty slug, so
nothing that validated before stops validating.

## Adversarial Scope Review

| Review area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Requirement proven | The POCs jointly prove HoBo's credential plane: attested workload identity, end-user auth, secretless config, XAA delegation, bounded availability, recovery, and audit export. |
| Persona/user goal | Platform engineers get keyless deployment credentials, app developers get contract-equivalent auth/config, SecOps gets XAA governance, and Yard operators get bounded recovery and observability. |
| BDD mapping | Accepted POCs map to the four BDD slices in `README.md`; no accepted POC stands alone without a slice. |
| Boundary map | Every external or internal dependency is a named mocked provider with a Pact decision in `contracts/pact-inventory.md`. |
| Useful implementation kept | Deterministic fail-closed ordering, reference-only token refs, attestation-derived tenants, signed renewal grace, inferred XAA scope ceiling, and redacted audit export. |
| Accidental or unsafe details discarded | Live OAuth, KMS/HSM, JWKS, SCIM, TLS, Relay, SIEM, secret-store, provider, and policy-engine calls are excluded. |
| Invalidated assumptions | Linear child POCs are already completed individually, but the epic still needed one synthesized reference path showing how they compose. |
| Edge and abuse cases | Forged workload tenant, wrong issuer, revoked session, confused deputy, token replay, stale static key, relay cross-tenant attach, and plaintext leakage all stay explicit. |
| Conflicts with docs/ADRs | No conflicts found; the rollup follows Plan 06 and ADR identity/security guidance, while keeping Plan 12 Relay/network transport out of production scope. |
| Superseded/deferred/split | SDK authoring, provider adapter implementation, real policy engine, real Relay transport, service mesh, and provider-side Pact verification are deferred outside this PR. |
| Feature drift risk | Blindly copying POC internals would make the reference look production-ready; the rollup keeps behavior and contracts only. |
| Simulation risk | The harness must report mocked providers and empty live network calls so it cannot be mistaken for a deployed identity service. |
| Contract brittleness risk | Pact fixtures focus on boundary request/response compatibility and avoid asserting entire business workflows. |
| Active epic conflict | The reference path is unique to Identity/XAA and does not modify other epic reference directories. |
