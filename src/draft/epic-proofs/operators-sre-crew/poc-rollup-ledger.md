## Cascade absorptions

Changes to referenced experience proofs that this rollup has taken in.

| Referenced proof | Change | Effect on this rollup |
|---|---|---|
| `src/draft/exp-proofs/dx/sre-drift-remediation-journey-contract` | `data-models/proof.cue` | none |

All of these are the same edit, applied across 58 draft proofs at once. Each
ships a `data-models/proof.proto` declaring `message ProofIdentity { string
slug = 1; string layer = 2; }` beside a `proof.cue` that defined a bare
anonymous `slug`/`layer` record — a record with no name to tie it to the
message it is supposed to constrain, which is what `architecture:guard`
reports as `missing-cue-constraints`. The record is now the named definition
`#ProofIdentity`, embedded at top level so the file still reads as the same
concrete data.

One constraint changed with it: `slug: string` became `slug: string & !=""`.
The old form restated proto3's declared type and refused nothing, so a proof
identifying itself with the empty string validated. Measured with cue v0.14.0,
old against new: `slug: ""` goes 0 → 1 and nothing else moves — a well-formed
record stays 0, `slug: 7` stays 1, `layer: "ux"` stays 1.

No disposition, evidence path, Linear link, or acceptance claim in the table
above moves. No proof in this epic identifies itself with an empty slug, so
nothing that validated before stops validating.
