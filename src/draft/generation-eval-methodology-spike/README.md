# Generation Eval Methodology Spike

Independent POC for HOBO-351. It records the ADR-0097 recommendation in an executable shape so the
decision can be checked like a contract before implementation work starts.

## Recommendation

- Use a hybrid evaluator: programmatic checks, golden-trajectory reproduction, LLM judges, and
  human-label calibration where semantic quality needs it.
- Treat `trajectoryGolden` as the stable Golden Suite primitive for generated implementations and
  trainable semantic functions.
- Require train/held-out/adversarial split separation and independent calibration so the optimizer
  cannot promote by gaming its own judge.
- Keep min-sample floors explicit; underpowered evals stay in shadow as `inconclusive`.

## Verification

```powershell
npm.cmd --prefix src\draft\generation-eval-methodology-spike test
```
