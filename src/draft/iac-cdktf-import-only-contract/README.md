# @hobo/iac-cdktf import-only backend contract

Independent proof for HOBO-191. The package models `@hobo/iac-cdktf` as a
read-only `IacProvider` adapter for brownfield CDKTF/Terraform state. It reads
existing state into HoBo resource records and rejects authoring operations.

## Proven behavior

- `refresh({ stateFile })` reads a CDKTF/Terraform state fixture into HoBo
  resource records.
- Mapped Terraform resource types become `adopted` records with CDKTF
  provenance and PortabilityReport entries.
- Unknown Terraform resource types become `external` records instead of being
  dropped.
- `preview`, `apply`, and `destroy` reject with the precise import-only error.
- The import -> plan -> no-op diff conformance path stays drift-detect only.
- A proposed delete/create against adopted resources is blocked before apply.
- Malformed or partial state files fail closed.
- The public `.d.mts` surface is consumed by a strict TypeScript fixture.

## Scope boundaries

This is the backend/read-path contract only. It does not implement the
`hobo import` command family, production `external`/`adopted` resource kinds,
real CDKTF execution, Pulumi/OpenTofu/Crossplane adapters, or authoring new
infrastructure.
