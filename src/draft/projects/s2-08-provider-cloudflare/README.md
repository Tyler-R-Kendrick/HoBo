# S2-08 @hobo/provider-cloudflare draft POC (HOBO-623)

Draft traceability copy of the S2-08 Cloudflare provider slice. **Production code
will live in `packages/providers/provider-cloudflare/`** once S2-06 merges. This
tree promotes the provider-manifest and conformance-evidence flows from
[`providers-iac-build-adapters`](../../epic-proofs/providers-iac-build-adapters/)
and the HOBO-165 contract proof.

## Scope (in)

- Initial capability ports: **web/service** (Workers), **kv**, **objectStore** (R2)
- Equivalence-class mappings per port
- Typed `cloudflare.with.worker/r2/kv` option builders
- Published Capability Manifest (`capabilities.json`, `auth.json`, `cost.json`, FR-031)
- hello-bindle resource realization (Worker + R2 + KV)
- Recorded-fixture provider-capability conformance (local + camp tags)

## Scope (out)

- Live Terraform/Wrangler execution against real Cloudflare accounts
- Production `packages/providers/provider-cloudflare/` workspace slot (blocked on S2-06)
- D1, Queues, DNS, Hyperdrive (retained in HOBO-165 contract proof only)

## Validation

```bash
pnpm --prefix src/draft/projects/s2-08-provider-cloudflare build
pnpm --prefix src/draft/projects/s2-08-provider-cloudflare test
```

## Architecture evidence

- `data-models/` — protobuf + CUE constraints for capability manifest and provider ports
- `contracts/provider-cloudflare-boundary.pact.json` — ProviderCloudflareBoundary pact
- `ADR.md` — parse-don't-validate and realize-emission evidence

## Promotion path

Blocked on HOBO-621 (S2-06 `@hobo/iac-pulumi`). When unblocked, promote to
`packages/providers/provider-cloudflare/` with credentialed CI conformance lane.
