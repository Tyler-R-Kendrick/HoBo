# HOBO-700 Runtime Code-Mutation Pattern ↔ ADR-0048 Contract

Independent POC for [HOBO-700](https://linear.app/quickdeploy-ai/issue/HOBO-700): confirms the
runtime-code-mutation pattern doc links [ADR-0048](../../../../docs/design/adr/03-data-plane.md#adr-0048)
and that stale cross-refs were retargeted to current design-suite paths.

## Scope

- Validates `docs/patterns/runtime-code-mutation-persistence.md` cites ADR-0048 in Relevance + Sources.
- Validates retargeted Plan/ADR links resolve from the pattern file.
- Does not implement persisted mutation tooling (ADR-0048 runtime path remains future work).

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --prefix src/draft/technical-proofs/hobo-700-runtime-code-mutation-pattern-adr-contract test
```
