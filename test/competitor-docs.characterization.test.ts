/**
 * Characterization (approval / snapshot) tests for the competitor-corpus
 * generators.
 *
 * Why these exist separately from `competitor-docs.test.ts`: that file asserts
 * *rules* ("an unknown category is rejected"). These assert *output* — the
 * exact markdown three generators emit. Those generators write files that are
 * committed to the repo and read by humans, and until now nothing pinned their
 * shape: a change to a column, a separator, a sort order or a pluralization
 * would have sailed through every existing test and landed silently in 90
 * documents.
 *
 * `toMatchFileSnapshot` is the repo's Verify/ApprovalTests equivalent: the
 * approved output lives in a committed file under `__snapshots__/`, reviewed
 * as part of the diff, and updated deliberately with `vitest -u`. Inline
 * snapshots were rejected for this because the approved artifact *is* markdown
 * — reviewing it as markdown in its own file is the entire point.
 *
 * The corpus here is a fixed synthetic fixture, never the live one. Snapshotting
 * the real corpus would repaint these files on every capture added and train
 * everyone to run `-u` without reading, which is how approval testing dies.
