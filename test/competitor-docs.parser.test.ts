/**
 * Adversarial and property tests for the competitor front-matter parser.
 *
 * The parser is hand-rolled on purpose — the shape it reads is fixed and flat,
 * so a scoped parser beats a YAML runtime for docs linting. The cost of that
 * choice is that its edge behaviour is *ours*, and until now none of it was
 * pinned: the existing suite only fed it well-formed captures, so every
 * malformed, hostile, or merely unusual input was untested.
 *
 * These tests do two jobs:
 *
 *   1. **Adversarial table** — inputs a hand-written parser typically dies on:
 *      hostile keys, unterminated quotes, orphaned sequence items, CRLF, and
 *      structural nonsense. The bar is "never throws, never silently produces
 *      a wrong-typed value", not "parses it correctly".
 *   2. **Deterministic fuzz** — a seeded generator producing thousands of
 *      mutated front-matter blocks. Seeded rather than random so a failure is
 *      reproducible from the seed printed in the assertion, and so CI cannot
 *      go red for a different reason than the last run.
 *
 * `fast-check` is deliberately not used here. `pnpm test:property` scopes it to
 * `@hobo/fuzz` control-plane simulators, and pulling it into the root manifest
 * for one docs-script parser would add a dependency to the very tool whose
 * design note is that it has none.
