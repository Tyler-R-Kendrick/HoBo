/**
 * The suite must not write into the developer's real HoBo home.
 *
 * Much of this workspace resolves its state directory as
 * `process.env.HOBO_HOME ?? join(HOME, ".hobo")`, so a test that calls such an
 * API without an explicit `hoboHome` writes where a real session would. That
 * happened: a clean run of `packages/code` left 33 files under `~/.hobo/durable`
 * — chats, evidence, and an auth session written by a test whose only assertion
 * was that `auth --help` prints a help page.
 *
 * `test/setup/isolate-hobo-home.ts` fixes it by pointing every test file's
 * `HOBO_HOME` at a throwaway directory. This file is the guard on that fix: the
 * point of the setup is that the next test somebody writes cannot reintroduce
 * the fault, and a guarantee nothing checks is a guarantee that quietly stops
 * holding.
 *
 * It asserts the *mechanism* rather than the absence of files in the real home,
 * because the real home may legitimately contain a developer's own data — this
 * suite is not entitled to look at it, let alone assert about its contents.
