    // reported ~40 failures on a clean tree and no real regression could be
    // seen through the noise. None of these are skipped — each runs under the
    // runner that owns it:
    //
    //  - `external/` is vendored third-party source. `external/ts-autocode` is
    //    a git submodule with its own repository and CI; `external/pixel-agents`
    //    is a vendored checkout. Both carry their own toolchains and test setup,
    //    and neither is this workspace's to gate.
    //  - `dist/` is build output. Every compiled `*.test.js` there is a second,
    //    staler copy of a source test that already runs, so collecting it doubles
    //    the suite and reports failures against code nobody edited.
    //  - Playwright specs drive a real browser through `@playwright/test`, whose
    //    `test.describe` has no meaning under vitest. They run from their own
    //    `playwright.config.ts` (see `packages/pixel-village`).
    //
    // The bare root run is still not the repo-wide gate — packages carry their
    // own vitest configs with their own environments and setup files, and running
    // them all in one process with `isolate: false` makes independent suites
    // interfere. `pnpm run test:all` (turbo, one config per package) is that gate;
    // this config backs `test:file`/`test:name`, which target one file or one test.
