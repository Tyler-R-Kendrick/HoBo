/**
 * Resolve every workspace package to its `src` entrypoint for the coverage lane.
 *
 * Without this the reported number is badly wrong — understated, not inflated.
 * Workspace packages publish `exports` pointing at `dist/`, so a cross-package
 * import executes the built JavaScript. Coverage instruments `src/**` with
 * `all: true`, which loads every un-executed source file to give it a zero
 * baseline. A file whose logic ran *via dist* never merges with its `src` entry,
 * so it lands in that zero baseline and reports ~0% despite being exercised.
 *
 * Measured on `packages/testing`: **47.2% without this alias map, 91.0% with
 * it** — identical tests, identical 142 passing assertions. `pact-chaos.ts`
 * alone went 0.7% → 92.8%.
 *
 * This matters beyond a nicer number: chasing the un-aliased figure would mean
 * writing duplicate tests for code that is already covered, which is worse than
 * doing nothing.
 *
 * Only the bare specifier is aliased, and it is matched with an anchored regex
 * rather than a string. A string alias in Vite is a *prefix* match, so
 * `"@hobo/core"` also swallows `@hobo/core/total-access` and rewrites it to
 * `packages/core/src/index.ts/total-access` — that mistake failed 301 test
 * files here before the anchor was added. Subpath imports must keep resolving
 * through the package's own `exports` map, because mapping a subpath to a
 * source file is the package's business, not this config's.
